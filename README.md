# Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio's zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust's ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system's event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you enable the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.49.0", features = ["full"] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) => return,
                    Ok(n) => n,
                    Err(e) => {
                        eprintln!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.71.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.48 to now  - Rust 1.71
 * 1.39 to 1.47 - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn't follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)
 * `1.47.x` - LTS release until September 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.43.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = "~1.43", features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025.
