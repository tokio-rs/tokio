# tokio-process

An implementation of process management for Tokio

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/tokio-process/0.2.4/tokio_process)

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio-process = "0.2"
```

Next you can use this in conjunction with the `tokio` and `futures` crates:

```rust,no_run
use std::process::Command;

use futures::Future;
use tokio_process::CommandExt;

fn main() {
    // Use the standard library's `Command` type to build a process and
    // then execute it via the `CommandExt` trait.
    let child = Command::new("echo").arg("hello").arg("world").spawn_async();

    // Make sure our child succeeded in spawning and process the result
    let future = child
        .expect("failed to spawn")
        .map(|status| println!("exit status: {}", status))
        .map_err(|e| panic!("failed to wait for exit: {}", e));

    // Send the future to the tokio runtime for execution
    tokio::run(future)
}
```
