/// This function returns a future whose return type is [`Result`]`<T,`[`Elapsed`]`>`, where `T` is the
/// return type of the provided future.
///
/// If the provided future completes immediately, then the future returned from
/// this function is guaranteed to complete immediately with an [`Ok`] variant

/// # Cancellation
///
/// Cancelling a timeout is done by dropping the future. No additional cleanup
/// or other work is required.
///
/// The original future may be obtained by calling [`Timeout::into_inner`]. This
/// consumes the `Timeout`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create a new `Timeout` set to expire in 10 milliseconds.
///
/// ```rust
/// use tokio::time::timeout;
/// use tokio::sync::oneshot;
///
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// # async fn dox() {
/// let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
/// # tx.send(()).unwrap();
///
/// // Wrap the future with a `Timeout` set to expire in 10 milliseconds.
/// if let Err(_) = timeout(Duration::from_millis(10), rx).await {
///     println!("did not receive value within 10 ms");
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function panics if there is no current timer set.
///
/// It can be triggered when [`Builder::enable_time`] or
/// [`Builder::enable_all`] are not included in the builder.
///
/// It can also panic whenever a timer is created outside of a
/// Tokio runtime. That is why `rt.block_on(sleep(...))` will panic,
/// since the function is executed outside of the runtime.
/// Whereas `rt.block_on(async {sleep(...).await})` doesn't panic.
/// And this is because wrapping the function on an async makes it lazy,
/// and so gets executed inside the runtime successfully without
/// panicking.
