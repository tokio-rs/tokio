//! Stream utilities for Tokio.
//!
//! A `Stream` is an asynchronous sequence of values. It can be thought of as an asynchronous version of the standard library's `Iterator` trait.
//!
//! This module provides helpers to work with them.

/// An extension trait for `Stream`s that provides a variety of convenient
/// combinator functions.
pub trait StreamExt: Stream {
    /// Creates a future that resolves to the next item in the stream.
    ///
    /// Equivalent to:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// async fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that because `next` doesn't take ownership over the stream,
    /// the [`Stream`] type must be [`Unpin`]. If you want to use `next` with a
    /// [`!Unpin`](Unpin) stream, you'll first have to pin the stream. This can
    /// be done by boxing the stream using [`Box::pin`] or
    /// pinning it to the stack using the `pin_mut!` macro from the `pin_utils`
    /// crate.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # #[tokio::main]
    /// # async fn main() {
    /// use tokio::stream::{self, StreamExt};
    ///
    /// let mut stream = stream::iter(1..=3);
    ///
    /// assert_eq!(stream.next().await, Some(1));
    /// assert_eq!(stream.next().await, Some(2));
    /// assert_eq!(stream.next().await, Some(3));
    /// assert_eq!(stream.next().await, None);

    /// Maps this stream's items to a different type, returning a new stream of
    /// the resulting type.
    ///
    /// The provided closure is executed over all elements of this stream as
    /// they are made available. It is executed inline with calls to
    /// [`poll_next`](Stream::poll_next).
    ///
    /// Note that this function consumes the stream passed into it and returns a
    /// wrapped version of it, similar to the existing `map` methods in the
    /// standard library.

    /// use tokio::stream::{self, StreamExt};
    ///
    /// let stream = stream::iter(1..=3);
