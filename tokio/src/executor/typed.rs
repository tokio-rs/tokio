use crate::executor::SpawnError;

/// A value that spawns futures of a specific type.
///
/// The trait is generic over `T`: the type of future that can be spawened. This
/// is useful for implementing an executor that is only able to spawn a specific
/// type of future.
///
/// The [`spawn`] function is used to submit the future to the executor. Once
/// submitted, the executor takes ownership of the future and becomes
/// responsible for driving the future to completion.
///
/// This trait is useful as a bound for applications and libraries in order to
/// be generic over futures that are `Send` vs. `!Send`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Consider a function that provides an API for draining a `Stream` in the
/// background. To do this, a task must be spawned to perform the draining. As
/// such, the function takes a stream and an executor on which the background
/// task is spawned.

///         Poll::Ready(())

///
/// By doing this, the `drain` fn can accept a stream that is `!Send` as long as
/// the supplied executor is able to spawn `!Send` types.
