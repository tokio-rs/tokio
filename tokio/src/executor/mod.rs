//! Task execution utilities.
//!
//! In the Tokio execution model, futures are lazy. When a future is created, no
//! work is performed. In order for the work defined by the future to happen,
//! the future must be submitted to an executor. A future that is submitted to
//! an executor is called a "task".
//!
//! The executor is responsible for ensuring that [`Future::poll`] is
//! called whenever the task is [notified]. Notification happens when the
//! internal state of a task transitions from "not ready" to ready. For
//! example, a socket might have received data and a call to `read` will now be
//! able to succeed.
//!
//! The specific strategy used to manage the tasks is left up to the
//! executor. There are two main flavors of executors: single-threaded and
//! multi-threaded. Tokio provides implementation for both of these in the
//! [`runtime`] module.
//!
//! # `Executor` trait.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Executor`] trait (re-exported from
//! [`tokio-executor`]), which describes the API that all executors must
//! implement.
//!
//! A free [`spawn`] function is provided that allows spawning futures onto the
//! default executor (tracked via a thread-local variable) without referencing a
//! handle. It is expected that all executors will set a value for the default
//! executor. This value will often be set to the executor itself, but it is
//! possible that the default executor might be set to a different executor.
//!
//! For example, a single threaded executor might set the default executor to a
//! thread pool instead of itself, allowing futures to spawn new tasks onto the
//! thread pool when those tasks are `Send`.
