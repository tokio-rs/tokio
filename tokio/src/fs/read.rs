/// Reads the entire contents of a file into a bytes vector.
///
/// This is an async version of [`std::fs::read`].
///
/// This is a convenience function for using [`File::open`] and [`read_to_end`]
/// with fewer imports and without an intermediate variable. It pre-allocates a
/// buffer based on the file size when available, so it is generally faster than
/// reading into a vector created with `Vec::new()`.
///
/// This operation is implemented by running the equivalent blocking operation
/// on a separate thread pool using [`spawn_blocking`].
///
/// [`File::open`]: super::File::open
/// [`read_to_end`]: crate::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_end
/// [`spawn_blocking`]: crate::task::spawn_blocking
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function will return an error if `path` does not already exist.
/// Other errors may also be returned according to [`OpenOptions::open`].
///
/// [`OpenOptions::open`]: super::OpenOptions::open
///
/// It will also return an error if it encounters while reading an error
/// of a kind other than [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`].
///
/// [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`]: std::io::ErrorKind::Interrupted
///
/// # io_uring support
///
/// On Linux, you can also use io_uring for executing system calls. To enable
/// io_uring, you need to specify the `--cfg tokio_unstable` flag at compile time,
/// enable the io-uring cargo feature, and set the `Builder::enable_io_uring`
/// runtime option.
///
/// Support for io_uring is currently experimental, so its behavior may change
/// or it may be removed in future versions.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// use tokio::fs;
/// use std::net::SocketAddr;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + 'static>> {
///     let contents = fs::read("address.txt").await?;
///     let foo: SocketAddr = String::from_utf8_lossy(&contents).parse()?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
