/// Options and flags which can be used to configure how a file is opened.

/// This builder exposes the ability to configure how a [`File`] is opened and
/// what operations are permitted on the open file. The [`File::open`] and
/// [`File::create`] methods are aliases for commonly used options using this
/// builder.
///
/// Generally speaking, when using `OpenOptions`, you'll first call [`new`],
/// then chain calls to methods to set each option, then call [`open`], passing
/// the path of the file you're trying to open. This will give you a
/// [`io::Result`][result] with a [`File`] inside that you can further operate
/// on.
///
/// This is a specialized version of [`std::fs::OpenOptions`] for usage from
/// the Tokio runtime.
///
/// `From<std::fs::OpenOptions>` is implemented for more advanced configuration
/// than the methods provided here.
