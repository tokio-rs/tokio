//! Opt-in yield points for improved cooperative scheduling.
//!
//! A single call to [`poll`] on a top-level task may potentially do a lot of
//! work before it returns `Poll::Pending`. If a task runs for a long period of
//! time without yielding back to the executor, it can starve other tasks
//! waiting on that executor to execute them, or drive underlying resources.
//! Since Rust does not have a runtime, it is difficult to forcibly preempt a
//! long-running task. Instead, this module provides an opt-in mechanism for
//! futures to collaborate with the executor to avoid starvation.
//!
//! Consider a future like this one:
//!
//! ```
//! # use tokio::stream::{Stream, StreamExt};
//! async fn drop_all<I: Stream + Unpin>(mut input: I) {
//!     while let Some(_) = input.next().await {}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It may look harmless, but consider what happens under heavy load if the
//! input stream is _always_ ready. If we spawn `drop_all`, the task will never
//! yield, and will starve other tasks and resources on the same executor. With
//! opt-in yield points, this problem is alleviated:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use tokio::stream::{Stream, StreamExt};
//! async fn drop_all<I: Stream + Unpin>(mut input: I) {
//!     while let Some(_) = input.next().await {
//!         tokio::coop::proceed().await;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `proceed` future will coordinate with the executor to make sure that
//! every so often control is yielded back to the executor so it can run other
//! tasks.
//!
//! # Placing yield points
//!
//! Voluntary yield points should be placed _after_ at least some work has been
//! done. If they are not, a future sufficiently deep in the task hierarchy may
//! end up _never_ getting to run because of the number of yield points that
//! inevitably appear before it is reached. In general, you will want yield
//! points to only appear in "leaf" futures -- those that do not themselves poll
//! other futures. By doing this, you avoid double-counting each iteration of
//! the outer future against the cooperating budget.
//!
//! [`poll`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll
