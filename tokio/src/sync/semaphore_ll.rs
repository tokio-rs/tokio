//! Thread-safe, asynchronous counting semaphore.
//!
//! A `Semaphore` instance holds a set of permits. Permits are used to
//! synchronize access to a shared resource.
//!
//! Before accessing the shared resource, callers acquire a permit from the
//! semaphore. Once the permit is acquired, the caller then enters the critical
//! section. If no permits are available, then acquiring the semaphore returns
//! `Pending`. The task is woken once a permit becomes available.
