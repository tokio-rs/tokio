/// An asynchronous reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`Mutex`] does not distinguish between readers or writers
/// that acquire the lock, therefore causing any tasks waiting for the lock to
/// become available to yield. An `RwLock` will allow any number of readers to
/// acquire the lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// The priority policy of Tokio's read-write lock is _fair_ (or
/// [_write-preferring_]), in order to ensure that readers cannot starve
/// writers. Fairness is ensured using a first-in, first-out queue for the tasks
/// awaiting the lock; if a task that wishes to acquire the write lock is at the
/// head of the queue, read locks will not be given out until the write lock has
/// been released. This is in contrast to the Rust standard library's
/// `std::sync::RwLock`, where the priority policy is dependent on the
/// operating system's implementation.
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies [`Send`] to be shared across threads. The RAII guards
/// returned from the locking methods implement [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html)
/// (and [`DerefMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html)
/// for the `write` methods) to allow access to the content of the lock.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use tokio::sync::RwLock;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
///     // many reader locks can be held at once
///     {
///         let r1 = lock.read().await;
///         let r2 = lock.read().await;
///         assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///         assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
///     } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
///     // only one write lock may be held, however
///     {
///         let mut w = lock.write().await;
///         *w += 1;
///         assert_eq!(*w, 6);
///     } // write lock is dropped here
