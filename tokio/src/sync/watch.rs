#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "sync"), allow(dead_code, unreachable_pub))]

//! A single-producer, multi-consumer channel that only retains the *last* sent
//! value.
//!
//! This channel is useful for watching for changes to a value from multiple
//! points in the code base, for example, changes to configuration values.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! [`channel`] returns a [`Sender`] / [`Receiver`] pair. These are the producer
//! and consumer halves of the channel. The channel is created with an initial
//! value.
//!
//! Each [`Receiver`] independently tracks the last value *seen* by its caller.
//!
//! To access the **current** value stored in the channel and mark it as *seen*
//! by a given [`Receiver`], use [`Receiver::borrow_and_update()`].
//!
//! To access the current value **without** marking it as *seen*, use
//! [`Receiver::borrow()`]. (If the value has already been marked *seen*,
//! [`Receiver::borrow()`] is equivalent to [`Receiver::borrow_and_update()`].)
//!
//! For more information on when to use these methods, see
//! [here](#borrow_and_update-versus-borrow).
//!
//! ## Change notifications
//!
//! The [`Receiver`] half provides an asynchronous [`changed`] method. This
//! method is ready when a new, *unseen* value is sent via the [`Sender`] half.
//!
//! * [`Receiver::changed()`] returns `Ok(())` on receiving a new value, or
//!   `Err(`[`error::RecvError`]`)` if the [`Sender`] has been dropped.
//! * If the current value is *unseen* when calling [`changed`], then
//!   [`changed`] will return immediately. If the current value is *seen*, then
//!   it will sleep until either a new message is sent via the [`Sender`] half,
//!   or the [`Sender`] is dropped.
//! * On completion, the [`changed`] method marks the new value as *seen*.
//! * At creation, the initial value is considered *seen*. In other words,
//!   [`Receiver::changed()`] will not return until a subsequent value is sent.
//! * New [`Receiver`] instances can be created with [`Sender::subscribe()`].
//!   The current value at the time the [`Receiver`] is created is considered
//!   *seen*.
//!
//! ## `borrow_and_update` versus `borrow`
//!
//! If the receiver intends to await notifications from [`changed`] in a loop,
//! [`Receiver::borrow_and_update()`] should be preferred over
//! [`Receiver::borrow()`].  This avoids a potential race where a new value is
//! sent between [`changed`] being ready and the value being read. (If
//! [`Receiver::borrow()`] is used, the loop may run twice with the same value.)
//!
//! If the receiver is only interested in the current value, and does not intend
//! to wait for changes, then [`Receiver::borrow()`] can be used. It may be more
//! convenient to use [`borrow`](Receiver::borrow) since it's an `&self`
//! method---[`borrow_and_update`](Receiver::borrow_and_update) requires `&mut
//! self`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The following example prints `hello! world! `.
//!
//! ```
//! use tokio::sync::watch;
//! use tokio::time::{Duration, sleep};
//!
//! # async fn dox() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let (tx, mut rx) = watch::channel("hello");
//!
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     // Use the equivalent of a "do-while" loop so the initial value is
//!     // processed before awaiting the `changed()` future.
//!     loop {
//!         println!("{}! ", *rx.borrow_and_update());
//!         if rx.changed().await.is_err() {
//!             break;
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
//! tx.send("world")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Closing
//!
//! [`Sender::is_closed`] and [`Sender::closed`] allow the producer to detect
//! when all [`Receiver`] handles have been dropped. This indicates that there
//! is no further interest in the values being produced and work can be stopped.
//!
//! The value in the channel will not be dropped until the sender and all
//! receivers have been dropped.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! Both [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`] are thread safe. They can be moved to other
//! threads and can be used in a concurrent environment. Clones of [`Receiver`]
//! handles may be moved to separate threads and also used concurrently.
