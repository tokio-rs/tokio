#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "sync"), allow(dead_code, unreachable_pub))]

//! A multi-producer, single-consumer queue for sending values across
//! asynchronous tasks.
//!
//! Similar to `std`, channel creation provides [`Receiver`] and [`Sender`]
//! handles. [`Receiver`] implements `Stream` and allows a task to read values
//! out of the channel. If there is no message to read, the current task will be
//! notified when a new value is sent. If the channel is at capacity, the send
//! is rejected and the task will be notified when additional capacity is
//! available. In other words, the channel provides backpressure.
//!
//! This module provides two variants of the channel: A bounded and an unbounded
//! variant. The bounded variant has a limit on the number of messages that the
//! channel can store, and if this limit is reached, trying to send another
//! message will sleep until a message is received from the channel. An unbounded
//! channel has an infinite capacity, so the `send` method never does any kind of
//! sleeping. This makes the [`UnboundedSender`] usable from both synchronous and
//! asynchronous code.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all [`Sender`] handles have been dropped, it is no longer
//! possible to send values into the channel. This is considered the termination
//! event of the stream. As such, `Receiver::poll` returns `Ok(Ready(None))`.
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`] handle is dropped, then messages can no longer
//! be read out of the channel. In this case, all further attempts to send will
//! result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! When the [`Receiver`] is dropped, it is possible for unprocessed messages to
//! remain in the channel. Instead, it is usually desirable to perform a "clean"
//! shutdown. To do this, the receiver first calls `close`, which will prevent
//! any further messages to be sent into the channel. Then, the receiver
//! consumes the channel to completion, at which point the receiver can be
//! dropped.
//!
//! # Communicating between sync and async code
//!
//! When you want to communicate between synchronous and asynchronous code, there
//! are two situations to consider:
//!
//! **Bounded channel**: If you need a bounded channel, you should use a bounded
//! Tokio `mpsc` channel for both directions of communication. To call the async
//! [`send`][bounded-send] or [`recv`][bounded-recv] methods in sync code, you
//! will need to use [`Handle::block_on`], which allow you to execute an async
//! method in synchronous code. This is necessary because a bounded channel may
//! need to wait for additional capacity to become available.
//!
//! **Unbounded channel**: You should use the kind of channel that matches where
//! the receiver is. So for sending a message _from async to sync_, you should
//! use [the standard library unbounded channel][std-unbounded] or
//! [crossbeam][crossbeam-unbounded].  Similarly, for sending a message _from sync
//! to async_, you should use an unbounded Tokio `mpsc` channel.
