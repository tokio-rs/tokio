//! An asynchronous `Mutex`-like type.
//!
//! This module provides [`Mutex`], a type that acts similarly to an asynchronous `Mutex`, with one
//! major difference: the [`MutexGuard`] returned by `lock` is not tied to the lifetime of the
//! `Mutex`. This enables you to acquire a lock, and then pass that guard into a future, and then
//! release it at some later point in time.
//!
//! This allows you to do something along the lines of:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use tokio::sync::Mutex;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let data1 = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
//!     let data2 = Arc::clone(&data1);
//!
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         let mut lock = data2.lock().await;
//!         *lock += 1;
//!     });
//!
//!     let mut lock = data1.lock().await;
//!     *lock += 1;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that in contrast to `std::sync::Mutex`, this implementation does not
//! poison the mutex when a thread holding the `MutexGuard` panics. In such a
//! case, the mutex will be unlocked. If the panic is caught, this might leave
//! the data protected by the mutex in an inconsistent state.
//!
