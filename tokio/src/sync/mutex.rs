//! An asynchronous `Mutex`-like type.
//!
//! This module provides [`Mutex`], a type that acts similarly to an asynchronous `Mutex`, with one
//! major difference: the [`MutexGuard`] returned by `lock` is not tied to the lifetime of the
//! `Mutex`. This enables you to acquire a lock, and then pass that guard into a future, and then
//! release it at some later point in time.
//!
//! This allows you to do something along the lines of:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use tokio::sync::Mutex;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let data1 = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
//!     let data2 = Arc::clone(&data1);
//!
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         let mut lock = data2.lock().await;
//!         *lock += 1;
//!     });
//!
//!     let mut lock = data1.lock().await;
//!     *lock += 1;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Another example
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #![warn(rust_2018_idioms)]
//!
//! use tokio::sync::Mutex;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!    let count = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
//!
//!    for _ in 0..5 {
//!        let my_count = Arc::clone(&count);
//!        tokio::spawn(async move {
//!            for _ in 0..10 {
//!                let mut lock = my_count.lock().await;
//!                *lock += 1;
//!                println!("{}", lock);
//!            }
//!        });
//!    }
//!
//!    loop {
//!        if *count.lock().await >= 50 {
//!            break;
//!        }
//!    }
//!   println!("Count hit 50.");
//! }
//! ```
//! There are a few things of note here to pay attention to in this example.
//! 1. The mutex is wrapped in an [`std::sync::Arc`] to allow it to be shared across threads.
//! 2. Each spawned task obtains a lock and releases it on every iteration.
//! 3. Mutation of the data the Mutex is protecting is done by de-referencing the the obtained lock
//!    as seen on lines 23 and 30.
//!
//! Tokio's Mutex works in a simple FIFO (first in, first out) style where as requests for a lock are
//! made Tokio will queue them up and provide a lock when it is that requester's turn. In that way
//! the Mutex is "fair" and predictable in how it distributes the locks to inner data. This is why
//! the output of this program is an in-order count to 50. Locks are released and reacquired
//! after every iteration, so basically, each thread goes to the back of the line after it increments
//! the value once. Also, since there is only a single valid lock at any given time there is no
//! possibility of a race condition when mutating the inner value.
//!
//! Note that in contrast to `std::sync::Mutex`, this implementation does not
//! poison the mutex when a thread holding the `MutexGuard` panics. In such a
//! case, the mutex will be unlocked. If the panic is caught, this might leave
//! the data protected by the mutex in an inconsistent state.
