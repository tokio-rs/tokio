/// An asynchronous `Mutex`-like type.
///
/// This type acts similarly to [`std::sync::Mutex`], with two major
/// differences: [`lock`] is an async method so does not block, and the lock
/// guard is designed to be held across `.await` points.
///
/// # Which kind of mutex should you use?
///
/// Contrary to popular belief, it is ok and often preferred to use the ordinary
/// [`Mutex`][std] from the standard library in asynchronous code.
///
/// The feature that the async mutex offers over the blocking mutex is the
/// ability to keep it locked across an `.await` point. This makes the async
/// mutex more expensive than the blocking mutex, so the blocking mutex should
/// be preferred in the cases where it can be used. The primary use case for the
/// async mutex is to provide shared mutable access to IO resources such as a
/// database connection. If the value behind the mutex is just data, it's
/// usually appropriate to use a blocking mutex such as the one in the standard
/// library or [`parking_lot`].
///
/// Note that, although the compiler will not prevent the std `Mutex` from holding
/// its guard across `.await` points in situations where the task is not movable
/// between threads, this virtually never leads to correct concurrent code in
/// practice as it can easily lead to deadlocks.
///
/// A common pattern is to wrap the `Arc<Mutex<...>>` in a struct that provides
/// non-async methods for performing operations on the data within, and only
/// lock the mutex inside these methods. The [mini-redis] example provides an
/// illustration of this pattern.
///
/// Additionally, when you _do_ want shared access to an IO resource, it is
/// often better to spawn a task to manage the IO resource, and to use message
/// passing to communicate with that task.
///

/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let data1 = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///     let data2 = Arc::clone(&data1);
///
///     tokio::spawn(async move {
///         let mut lock = data2.lock().await;
///         *lock += 1;
///     });
///
///     let mut lock = data1.lock().await;
///     *lock += 1;
/// }
/// ```
///
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use tokio::sync::Mutex;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let count = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///
///     for i in 0..5 {
///         let my_count = Arc::clone(&count);
///         tokio::spawn(async move {
///             for j in 0..10 {
///                 let mut lock = my_count.lock().await;
///                 *lock += 1;
///                 println!("{} {} {}", i, j, lock);
///             }
///         });
///     }
///
///     loop {
///         if *count.lock().await >= 50 {
///             break;
///         }
///     }
///     println!("Count hit 50.");
/// }
/// ```
/// There are a few things of note here to pay attention to in this example.
/// 1. The mutex is wrapped in an [`Arc`] to allow it to be shared across
///    threads.
/// 2. Each spawned task obtains a lock and releases it on every iteration.
/// 3. Mutation of the data protected by the Mutex is done by de-referencing
///    the obtained lock as seen on lines 12 and 19.
///
/// Tokio's Mutex works in a simple FIFO (first in, first out) style where all
/// calls to [`lock`] complete in the order they were performed. In that way the
/// Mutex is "fair" and predictable in how it distributes the locks to inner
/// data. Locks are released and reacquired after every iteration, so basically,
/// each thread goes to the back of the line after it increments the value once.
/// Note that there's some unpredictability to the timing between when the
/// threads are started, but once they are going they alternate predictably.
/// Finally, since there is only a single valid lock at any given time, there is
/// no possibility of a race condition when mutating the inner value.
///
/// Note that in contrast to [`std::sync::Mutex`], this implementation does not
/// poison the mutex when a thread holding the [`MutexGuard`] panics. In such a
/// case, the mutex will be unlocked. If the panic is caught, this might leave
/// the data protected by the mutex in an inconsistent state.
