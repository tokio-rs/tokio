//! A runtime implementation that runs everything on the current thread.
//!
//! [`current_thread::Runtime`][rt] is similar to the primary
//! [`Runtime`][concurrent-rt] except that it runs all components on the current
//! thread instead of using a thread pool. This means that it is able to spawn
//! futures that do not implement `Send`.
//!
//! Same as the default [`Runtime`][concurrent-rt], the
//! [`current_thread::Runtime`][rt] includes:
//!
//! * A [reactor] to drive I/O resources.
//! * An [executor] to execute tasks that use these I/O resources.
//! * A [timer] for scheduling work to run after a set period of time.
//!
//! Note that [`current_thread::Runtime`][rt] does not implement `Send` itself
//! and cannot be safely moved to other threads.
//!
//! # Spawning from other threads
//!
//! While [`current_thread::Runtime`][rt] does not implement `Send` and cannot
//! safely be moved to other threads, it provides a `Handle` that can be sent
//! to other threads and allows to spawn new tasks from there.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(async_await)]
//!
//! use tokio::runtime::current_thread::Runtime;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let mut runtime = Runtime::new().unwrap();
//! let handle = runtime.handle();
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     handle.spawn(async {
//!         println!("hello world");
//!     });
//! }).join().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Creating a new `Runtime` and running a future `f` until its completion and
//! returning its result.
//!
//! ```
//! use tokio::runtime::current_thread::Runtime;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut runtime = Runtime::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // Use the runtime...
//! // runtime.block_on(f); // where f is a future
//! ```
