    /// An owned permission to join on a task (await its termination).
    ///
    /// This can be thought of as the equivalent of [`std::thread::JoinHandle`]
    /// for a Tokio task rather than a thread. Note that the background task
    /// associated with this `JoinHandle` started running immediately when you
    /// called spawn, even if you have not yet awaited the `JoinHandle`.
    ///
    /// A `JoinHandle` *detaches* the associated task when it is dropped, which
    /// means that there is no longer any handle to the task, and no way to `join`
    /// on it.
    ///
    /// This `struct` is created by the [`task::spawn`] and [`task::spawn_blocking`]
    /// functions.
    ///
    /// # Cancel safety
    ///
    /// The `&mut JoinHandle<T>` type is cancel safe. If it is used as the event
    /// in a `tokio::select!` statement and some other branch completes first,
    /// then it is guaranteed that the output of the task is not lost.
    ///
    /// If a `JoinHandle` is dropped, then the task continues running in the
    /// background and its return value is lost.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Creation from [`task::spawn`]:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// # async fn doc() {
    /// let join_handle: task::JoinHandle<_> = task::spawn(async {
    ///     // some work here
    /// });
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Creation from [`task::spawn_blocking`]:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// # async fn doc() {
    /// let join_handle: task::JoinHandle<_> = task::spawn_blocking(|| {
    ///     // some blocking work here
    /// });
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The generic parameter `T` in `JoinHandle<T>` is the return type of the spawned task.
    /// If the return value is an `i32`, the join handle has type `JoinHandle<i32>`:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// # async fn doc() {
    /// let join_handle: task::JoinHandle<i32> = task::spawn(async {
    ///     5 + 3
    /// });
    /// # }
    ///
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If the task does not have a return value, the join handle has type `JoinHandle<()>`:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// # async fn doc() {
    /// let join_handle: task::JoinHandle<()> = task::spawn(async {
    ///     println!("I return nothing.");
    /// });
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that `handle.await` doesn't give you the return type directly. It is wrapped in a
    /// `Result` because panics in the spawned task are caught by Tokio. The `?` operator has
    /// to be double chained to extract the returned value:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    /// use std::io;
    ///
    /// # #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
    /// # async fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    /// let join_handle: task::JoinHandle<Result<i32, io::Error>> = tokio::spawn(async {
    ///     Ok(5 + 3)
    /// });
    ///
    /// let result = join_handle.await??;
    /// assert_eq!(result, 8);
    /// Ok(())
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If the task panics, the error is a [`JoinError`] that contains the panic:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # #[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
    /// # {
