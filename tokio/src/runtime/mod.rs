//! A batteries included runtime for applications using Tokio.
//!
//! Applications using Tokio require some runtime support in order to work:
//!
//! * A [driver] to drive I/O resources.
//! * An [executor] to execute tasks that use these I/O resources.
//! * A timer for scheduling work to run after a set period of time.
//!
//! While it is possible to setup each component manually, this involves a bunch
//! of boilerplate.
//!
//! [`Runtime`] bundles all of these various runtime components into a single
//! handle that can be started and shutdown together, eliminating the necessary
//! boilerplate to run a Tokio application.
//!
//! Most applications wont need to use [`Runtime`] directly. Instead, they will
//! use the [`tokio::main`] attribute macro, which uses [`Runtime`] under the hood.
//!
//! Creating a [`Runtime`] does the following:
//!
//! * Spawn a background thread running a [`Reactor`] instance.
//! * Start a thread pool for executing futures.
//! * Run an instance of `Timer` **per** thread pool worker thread.
//!
//! The thread pool uses a work-stealing strategy and is configured to start a
//! worker thread for each CPU core available on the system. This tends to be
//! the ideal setup for Tokio applications.
//!
//! A timer per thread pool worker thread is used to minimize the amount of
//! synchronization that is required for working with the timer.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Most applications will use the [`tokio::main`] attribute macro.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio::net::TcpListener;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let mut listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
//!
//!     loop {
//!         let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
//!
//!         tokio::spawn(async move {
//!             let mut buf = [0; 1024];
//!
//!             // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
//!             loop {
//!                 let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
//!                     // socket closed
//!                     Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
//!                     Ok(n) => n,
//!                     Err(e) => {
//!                         println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                         return;
//!                     }
//!                 };
//!
//!                 // Write the data back
//!                 if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
//!                     println!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                     return;
//!                 }
//!             }
//!         });
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! From within the context of the runtime, additional tasks are spawned using
//! the [`tokio::spawn`] function. Futures spawned using this function will be
//! executed on the same thread pool used by the [`Runtime`].
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] instance can also be used directly.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio::net::TcpListener;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//! use tokio::runtime::Runtime;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     // Create the runtime
//!     let mut rt = Runtime::new()?;
//!
//!     // Spawn the root task
//!     rt.block_on(async {
//!         let mut listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
//!
//!         loop {
//!             let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
//!
//!             tokio::spawn(async move {
//!                 let mut buf = [0; 1024];
//!
//!                 // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
//!                 loop {
//!                     let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
//!                         // socket closed
//!                         Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
//!                         Ok(n) => n,
//!                         Err(e) => {
//!                             println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                             return;
//!                         }
//!                     };
//!
//!                     // Write the data back
//!                     if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
