//! The Tokio runtime.
//!
//! Unlike other Rust programs, asynchronous applications require
//! runtime support. In particular, the following runtime services are
//! necessary:
//!
//! * An **I/O event loop**, called the driver, which drives I/O resources and
//!   dispatches I/O events to tasks that depend on them.
//! * A **scheduler** to execute [tasks] that use these I/O resources.
//! * A **timer** for scheduling work to run after a set period of time.
//!
//! Tokio's [`Runtime`] bundles all of these services as a single type, allowing
//! them to be started, shut down, and configured together. However, most
//! applications won't need to use [`Runtime`] directly. Instead, they can
//! use the [`tokio::main`] attribute macro, which creates a [`Runtime`] under
//! the hood.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Most applications will use the [`tokio::main`] attribute macro.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio::net::TcpListener;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let mut listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
//!
//!     loop {
//!         let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
//!
//!         tokio::spawn(async move {
//!             let mut buf = [0; 1024];
//!
//!             // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
//!             loop {
//!                 let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
//!                     // socket closed
//!                     Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
//!                     Ok(n) => n,
//!                     Err(e) => {
//!                         println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                         return;
//!                     }
//!                 };
//!
//!                 // Write the data back
//!                 if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
//!                     println!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                     return;
//!                 }
//!             }
//!         });
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! From within the context of the runtime, additional tasks are spawned using
//! the [`tokio::spawn`] function. Futures spawned using this function will be
//! executed on the same thread pool used by the [`Runtime`].
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] instance can also be used directly.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio::net::TcpListener;
//! use tokio::prelude::*;
//! use tokio::runtime::Runtime;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     // Create the runtime
//!     let mut rt = Runtime::new()?;
//!
//!     // Spawn the root task
//!     rt.block_on(async {
//!         let mut listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
//!
//!         loop {
//!             let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
//!
//!             tokio::spawn(async move {
//!                 let mut buf = [0; 1024];
//!
//!                 // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
//!                 loop {
//!                     let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
//!                         // socket closed
//!                         Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
//!                         Ok(n) => n,
//!                         Err(e) => {
//!                             println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                             return;
//!                         }
//!                     };
//!
//!                     // Write the data back
//!                     if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
//!                         println!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
//!                         return;
//!                     }
//!                 }
//!             });
//!         }
//!     })
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Runtime Configurations
//!
//! Tokio provides multiple task scheduling strategies, suitable for different
//! applications. The [runtime builder] or `#[tokio::main]` attribute may be
//! used to select which scheduler to use.
//!
//! #### Basic Scheduler
//!
//! The basic scheduler provides a _single-threaded_ future executor. All tasks
//! will be created and executed on the current thread. The basic scheduler
//! requires the `rt-core` feature flag, and can be selected using the
//! [`Builder::basic_scheduler`] method:
//! ```
//! use tokio::runtime;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let basic_rt = runtime::Builder::new()
//!     .basic_scheduler()
//!     .build()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! If the `rt-core` feature is enabled and `rt-threaded` is not,
//! [`Runtime::new`] will return a basic scheduler runtime by default.
//!
//! #### Threaded Scheduler
//!
//! The threaded scheduler executes futures on a _thread pool_, using a
//! work-stealing strategy. By default, it will start a worker thread for each
//! CPU core available on the system. This tends to be the ideal configurations
//! for most applications. The threaded scheduler requires the `rt-threaded` feature
//! flag, and can be selected using the  [`Builder::threaded_scheduler`] method:
//! ```
//! use tokio::runtime;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let threaded_rt = runtime::Builder::new()
//!     .threaded_scheduler()
//!     .build()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! If the `rt-threaded` feature flag is enabled, [`Runtime::new`] will return a
//! threaded scheduler runtime by default.
//!
//! Most applications should use the threaded scheduler, except in some niche
//! use-cases, such as when running only a single thread is required.
//!
//! #### Resource drivers
//!
//! When configuring a runtime by hand, no resource drivers are enabled by
//! default. In this case, attempting to use networking types or time types will
//! fail. In order to enable these types, the resource drivers must be enabled.
//! This is done with [`Builder::enable_io`] and [`Builder::enable_time`]. As a
//! shorthand, [`Builder::enable_all`] enables both resource drivers.
//!
//! ## Lifetime of spawned threads
//!
//! The runtime may spawn threads depending on its configuration and usage. The
//! threaded scheduler spawns threads to schedule tasks and calls to
//! `spawn_blocking` spawn threads to run blocking operations.
//!
//! While the `Runtime` is active, threads may shutdown after periods of being
//! idle. Once `Runtime` is dropped, all runtime threads are forcibly shutdown.
//! Any tasks that have not yet completed will be dropped.
