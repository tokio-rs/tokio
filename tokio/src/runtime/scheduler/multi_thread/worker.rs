//! A scheduler is initialized with a fixed number of workers. Each worker is
//! driven by a thread. Each worker has a "core" which contains data such as the
//! run queue and other state. When `block_in_place` is called, the worker's
//! "core" is handed off to a new thread allowing the scheduler to continue to
//! make progress while the originating thread blocks.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! Shutting down the runtime involves the following steps:
//!
//!  1. The Shared::close method is called. This closes the inject queue and
//!     OwnedTasks instance and wakes up all worker threads.
//!
//!  2. Each worker thread observes the close signal next time it runs
//!     Core::maintenance by checking whether the inject queue is closed.
//!     The Core::is_shutdown flag is set to true.
//!
//!  3. The worker thread calls `pre_shutdown` in parallel. Here, the worker
//!     will keep removing tasks from OwnedTasks until it is empty. No new
//!     tasks can be pushed to the OwnedTasks during or after this step as it
//!     was closed in step 1.
//!
//!  5. The workers call Shared::shutdown to enter the single-threaded phase of
//!     shutdown. These calls will push their core to Shared::shutdown_cores,
//!     and the last thread to push its core will finish the shutdown procedure.
//!
//!  6. The local run queue of each core is emptied, then the inject queue is
//!     emptied.
//!
//! At this point, shutdown has completed. It is not possible for any of the
//! collections to contain any tasks at this point, as each collection was
//! closed first, then emptied afterwards.
//!
//! ## Spawns during shutdown
//!
//! When spawning tasks during shutdown, there are two cases:
//!
//!  * The spawner observes the OwnedTasks being open, and the inject queue is
//!    closed.
//!  * The spawner observes the OwnedTasks being closed and doesn't check the
//!    inject queue.
//!
//! The first case can only happen if the OwnedTasks::bind call happens before
//! or during step 1 of shutdown. In this case, the runtime will clean up the
//! task in step 3 of shutdown.
//!
//! In the latter case, the task was not spawned and the task is immediately
//! cancelled by the spawner.
//!
//! The correctness of shutdown requires both the inject queue and OwnedTasks
//! collection to have a closed bit. With a close bit on only the inject queue,
//! spawning could run in to a situation where a task is successfully bound long
//! after the runtime has shut down. With a close bit on only the OwnedTasks,
//! the first spawning situation could result in the notification being pushed
//! to the inject queue after step 6 of shutdown, which would leave a task in
//! the inject queue indefinitely. This would be a ref-count cycle and a memory
//! leak.
