    /// Spawns a new asynchronous task, returning a

    /// The provided future will start running in the background immediately
    /// when `spawn` is called, even if you don't await the returned
    /// [`JoinHandle`].
    ///
    /// Spawning a task enables the task to execute concurrently to other tasks. The
    /// spawned task may execute on the current thread, or it may be sent to a
    /// different thread to be executed. The specifics depend on the current
    /// [`Runtime`](crate::runtime::Runtime) configuration. In a
    /// [running runtime][running-runtime], the task will start immediately in the
    /// background. On a blocked runtime, the user must drive the runtime forward (for
    /// example, by calling [`Runtime::block_on`](crate::runtime::Runtime::block_on)).
    ///
    /// It is guaranteed that spawn will not synchronously poll the task being spawned.
    /// This means that calling spawn while holding a lock does not pose a risk of
    /// deadlocking with the spawned task.
    ///
    /// There is no guarantee that a spawned task will execute to completion.
    /// When a runtime is shutdown, all outstanding tasks are dropped,
    /// regardless of the lifecycle of that task.
    ///
    /// This function must be called from the context of a Tokio runtime. Tasks running on
    /// the Tokio runtime are always inside its context, but you can also enter the context
    /// using the [`Runtime::enter`](crate::runtime::Runtime::enter()) method.
    ///
    /// [running-runtime]: ../runtime/index.html#driving-the-runtime
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// In this example, a server is started and `spawn` is used to start a new task
    /// that processes each received connection.
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// # #[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
    /// # {
    /// use tokio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
    ///
    /// use std::io;
    ///
    /// async fn process(socket: TcpStream) {
    ///     // ...
    /// # drop(socket);
    /// }
    ///
    /// #[tokio::main]

    ///     loop {
    ///         let (socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
    ///
    ///         tokio::spawn(async move {

    ///         });
    ///     }

    /// handles can be stored in a vector.

    ///     let s = format!("Starting background task {}.", id);
    ///     println!("{}", s);
    ///     s
    /// }
    ///
    /// let ops = vec![1, 2, 3];
    /// let mut tasks = Vec::with_capacity(ops.len());
    /// for op in ops {
    ///     // This call will make them start running in the background
    ///     // immediately.
    ///     tasks.push(tokio::spawn(my_background_op(op)));

    /// for task in tasks {
    ///     outputs.push(task.await.unwrap());
    /// }
    /// println!("{:?}", outputs);
    /// # }
    /// ```
    /// This example pushes the tasks to `outputs` in the order they were
    /// started in. If you do not care about the ordering of the outputs, then
    /// you can also use a [`JoinSet`].

    /// [`JoinSet`]: struct@crate::task::JoinSet

    ///
    /// Panics if called from **outside** of the Tokio runtime.

    /// # Using `!Send` values from a task
    ///
    /// The task supplied to `spawn` must implement `Send`. However, it is
    /// possible to **use** `!Send` values from the task as long as they only
    /// exist between calls to `.await`.
    ///
    /// For example, this will work:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// use std::rc::Rc;
    ///
    /// fn use_rc(rc: Rc<()>) {
    ///     // Do stuff w/ rc
    /// # drop(rc);
    /// }
    ///
    /// # #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
    /// # async fn main() {
    /// tokio::spawn(async {
    ///     // Force the `Rc` to stay in a scope with no `.await`
    ///     {
    ///         let rc = Rc::new(());
    ///         use_rc(rc.clone());
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     task::yield_now().await;
    /// }).await.unwrap();
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This will **not** work:
    ///
    /// ```compile_fail
    /// use tokio::task;
    ///
    /// use std::rc::Rc;
    ///
    /// fn use_rc(rc: Rc<()>) {
    ///     // Do stuff w/ rc
    /// # drop(rc);
    /// }
    ///
    /// #[tokio::main]
