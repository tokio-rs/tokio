    /// In general, issuing a blocking call or performing a lot of compute in a

    /// Tokio will spawn more blocking threads when they are requested through this
    /// function until the upper limit configured on the [`Builder`] is reached.
    /// After reaching the upper limit, the tasks are put in a queue.
    /// The thread limit is very large by default, because `spawn_blocking` is often
    /// used for various kinds of IO operations that cannot be performed
    /// asynchronously.  When you run CPU-bound code using `spawn_blocking`, you
    /// should keep this large upper limit in mind. When running many CPU-bound
    /// computations, a semaphore or some other synchronization primitive should be
    /// used to limit the number of computation executed in parallel. Specialized
    /// CPU-bound executors, such as [rayon], may also be a good fit.
    ///
    /// This function is intended for non-async operations that eventually finish on
    /// their own. If you want to spawn an ordinary thread, you should use
    /// [`thread::spawn`] instead.
    ///
    /// Closures spawned using `spawn_blocking` cannot be cancelled abruptly; there
    /// is no standard low level API to cause a thread to stop running.  However,
    /// a useful pattern is to pass some form of "cancellation token" into
    /// the thread.  This could be an [`AtomicBool`] that the task checks periodically.
    /// Another approach is to have the thread primarily read or write from a channel,
    /// and to exit when the channel closes; assuming the other side of the channel is dropped
    /// when cancellation occurs, this will cause the blocking task thread to exit
    /// soon after as well.
    ///
    /// When you shut down the executor, it will wait indefinitely for all blocking operations to
    /// finish. You can use [`shutdown_timeout`] to stop waiting for them after a
    /// certain timeout. Be aware that this will still not cancel the tasks — they
    /// are simply allowed to keep running after the method returns.  It is possible
    /// for a blocking task to be cancelled if it has not yet started running, but this
    /// is not guaranteed.
    ///
    /// Note that if you are using the single threaded runtime, this function will
    /// still spawn additional threads for blocking operations. The current-thread
    /// scheduler's single thread is only used for asynchronous code.
    ///
    /// # Related APIs and patterns for bridging asynchronous and blocking code
    ///
    /// In simple cases, it is sufficient to have the closure accept input
    /// parameters at creation time and return a single value (or struct/tuple, etc.).
    ///
    /// For more complex situations in which it is desirable to stream data to or from
    /// the synchronous context, the [`mpsc channel`] has `blocking_send` and
    /// `blocking_recv` methods for use in non-async code such as the thread created
    /// by `spawn_blocking`.
    ///
    /// Another option is [`SyncIoBridge`] for cases where the synchronous context
    /// is operating on byte streams.  For example, you might use an asynchronous
    /// HTTP client such as [hyper] to fetch data, but perform complex parsing
    /// of the payload body using a library written for synchronous I/O.
    ///
    /// Finally, see also [Bridging with sync code][bridgesync] for discussions
    /// around the opposite case of using Tokio as part of a larger synchronous
    /// codebase.
