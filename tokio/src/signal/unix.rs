///
/// In general signal handling on Unix is a pretty tricky topic, and this
/// structure is no exception! There are some important limitations to keep in
/// mind when using `Signal` streams:
///
/// * Signals handling in Unix already necessitates coalescing signals
///   together sometimes. This `Signal` stream is also no exception here in
///   that it will also coalesce signals. That is, even if the signal handler
///   for this process runs multiple times, the `Signal` stream may only return
///   one signal notification. Specifically, before `poll` is called, all
///   signal notifications are coalesced into one item returned from `poll`.
///   Once `poll` has been called, however, a further signal is guaranteed to
///   be yielded as an item.
///
///   Put another way, any element pulled off the returned listener corresponds to
///   *at least one* signal, but possibly more.
///
/// * Signal handling in general is relatively inefficient. Although some
///   improvements are possible in this crate, it's recommended to not plan on
///   having millions of signal channels open.
///
/// If you've got any questions about this feel free to open an issue on the
/// repo! New approaches to alleviate some of these limitations are always
/// appreciated!
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// The first time that a `Signal` instance is registered for a particular
/// signal kind, an OS signal-handler is installed which replaces the default
/// platform behavior when that signal is received, **for the duration of the
/// entire process**.
///
/// For example, Unix systems will terminate a process by default when it
/// receives `SIGINT`. But, when a `Signal` instance is created to listen for
/// this signal, the next `SIGINT` that arrives will be translated to a stream
/// event, and the process will continue to execute. **Even if this `Signal`
/// instance is dropped, subsequent `SIGINT` deliveries will end up captured by
/// Tokio, and the default platform behavior will NOT be reset**.
///
/// Thus, applications should take care to ensure the expected signal behavior
/// occurs as expected after listening for specific signals.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Wait for `SIGHUP`
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use tokio::signal::unix::{signal, SignalKind};
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     // An infinite stream of hangup signals.
///     let mut sig = signal(SignalKind::hangup())?;
///
///     // Print whenever a HUP signal is received
///     loop {
///         sig.recv().await;
///         println!("got signal HUP");
