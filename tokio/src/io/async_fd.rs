/// Associates an IO object backed by a Unix file descriptor with the tokio
/// reactor, allowing for readiness to be polled. The file descriptor must be of
/// a type that can be used with the OS polling facilities (ie, `poll`, `epoll`,
/// `kqueue`, etc), such as a network socket or pipe, and the file descriptor
/// must have the nonblocking mode set to true.
///
/// Creating an AsyncFd registers the file descriptor with the current tokio
/// Reactor, allowing you to directly await the file descriptor being readable
/// or writable. Once registered, the file descriptor remains registered until
/// the AsyncFd is dropped.
///
/// The AsyncFd takes ownership of an arbitrary object to represent the IO
/// object. It is intended that this object will handle closing the file
/// descriptor when it is dropped, avoiding resource leaks and ensuring that the
/// AsyncFd can clean up the registration before closing the file descriptor.
/// The [`AsyncFd::into_inner`] function can be used to extract the inner object
/// to retake control from the tokio IO reactor.
///
/// The inner object is required to implement [`AsRawFd`]. This file descriptor
/// must not change while [`AsyncFd`] owns the inner object, i.e. the
/// [`AsRawFd::as_raw_fd`] method on the inner type must always return the same
/// file descriptor when called multiple times. Failure to uphold this results
/// in unspecified behavior in the IO driver, which may include breaking
/// notifications for other sockets/etc.
///
/// Polling for readiness is done by calling the async functions [`readable`]
/// and [`writable`]. These functions complete when the associated readiness
/// condition is observed. Any number of tasks can query the same `AsyncFd` in
/// parallel, on the same or different conditions.
///
/// On some platforms, the readiness detecting mechanism relies on
/// edge-triggered notifications. This means that the OS will only notify Tokio
/// when the file descriptor transitions from not-ready to ready. For this to
/// work you should first try to read or write and only poll for readiness
/// if that fails with an error of [`std::io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`].
///
/// Tokio internally tracks when it has received a ready notification, and when
/// readiness checking functions like [`readable`] and [`writable`] are called,
/// if the readiness flag is set, these async functions will complete
/// immediately. This however does mean that it is critical to ensure that this
/// ready flag is cleared when (and only when) the file descriptor ceases to be
/// ready. The [`AsyncFdReadyGuard`] returned from readiness checking functions
/// serves this function; after calling a readiness-checking async function,
/// you must use this [`AsyncFdReadyGuard`] to signal to tokio whether the file
/// descriptor is no longer in a ready state.
///
/// ## Use with to a poll-based API
///
/// In some cases it may be desirable to use `AsyncFd` from APIs similar to
/// [`TcpStream::poll_read_ready`]. The [`AsyncFd::poll_read_ready`] and
/// [`AsyncFd::poll_write_ready`] functions are provided for this purpose.
/// Because these functions don't create a future to hold their state, they have
/// the limitation that only one task can wait on each direction (read or write)
/// at a time.
///
/// # Examples

/// This example shows how to turn [`std::net::TcpStream`] asynchronous using
/// `AsyncFd`.  It implements `read` as an async fn, and `AsyncWrite` as a trait
