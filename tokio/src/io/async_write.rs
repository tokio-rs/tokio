/// Writes bytes asynchronously.
///
/// The trait inherits from [`std::io::Write`] and indicates that an I/O object is
/// **nonblocking**. All non-blocking I/O objects must return an error when
/// bytes cannot be written instead of blocking the current thread.
///
/// Specifically, this means that the [`poll_write`] function will return one of
/// the following:
///
/// * `Poll::Ready(Ok(n))` means that `n` bytes of data was immediately
///   written.
///
/// * `Poll::Pending` means that no data was written from the buffer
///   provided. The I/O object is not currently writable but may become writable
///   in the future. Most importantly, **the current future's task is scheduled
///   to get unparked when the object is writable**. This means that like
///   `Future::poll` you'll receive a notification when the I/O object is
///   writable again.
///
/// * `Poll::Ready(Err(e))` for other errors are standard I/O errors coming from the
///   underlying object.
///
/// This trait importantly means that the [`write`][stdwrite] method only works in
/// the context of a future's task. The object may panic if used outside of a task.
///
/// Note that this trait also represents that the  [`Write::flush`][stdflush] method
/// works very similarly to the `write` method, notably that `Ok(())` means that the
/// writer has successfully been flushed, a "would block" error means that the
/// current task is ready to receive a notification when flushing can make more
/// progress, and otherwise normal errors can happen as well.
///
/// Utilities for working with `AsyncWrite` values are provided by
/// [`AsyncWriteExt`].

    /// Initiates or attempts to shut down this writer, returning success when
    /// the I/O connection has completely shut down.
    ///
    /// This method is intended to be used for asynchronous shutdown of I/O
    /// connections. For example this is suitable for implementing shutdown of a
    /// TLS connection or calling `TcpStream::shutdown` on a proxied connection.
    /// Protocols sometimes need to flush out final pieces of data or otherwise
    /// perform a graceful shutdown handshake, reading/writing more data as
    /// appropriate. This method is the hook for such protocols to implement the
    /// graceful shutdown logic.
    ///
    /// This `shutdown` method is required by implementers of the
    /// `AsyncWrite` trait. Wrappers typically just want to proxy this call
    /// through to the wrapped type, and base types will typically implement
    /// shutdown logic here or just return `Ok(().into())`. Note that if you're
    /// wrapping an underlying `AsyncWrite` a call to `shutdown` implies that
    /// transitively the entire stream has been shut down. After your wrapper's
    /// shutdown logic has been executed you should shut down the underlying
    /// stream.
    ///
    /// Invocation of a `shutdown` implies an invocation of `flush`. Once this
    /// method returns `Ready` it implies that a flush successfully happened
    /// before the shutdown happened. That is, callers don't need to call
    /// `flush` before calling `shutdown`. They can rely that by calling
    /// `shutdown` any pending buffered data will be written out.
    ///
    /// # Return value
    ///
    /// This function returns a `Poll<io::Result<()>>` classified as such:
    ///
    /// * `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` - indicates that the connection was
    ///   successfully shut down and is now safe to deallocate/drop/close
    ///   resources associated with it. This method means that the current task
    ///   will no longer receive any notifications due to this method and the
    ///   I/O object itself is likely no longer usable.
    ///
    /// * `Poll::Pending` - indicates that shutdown is initiated but could
    ///   not complete just yet. This may mean that more I/O needs to happen to
    ///   continue this shutdown operation. The current task is scheduled to
    ///   receive a notification when it's otherwise ready to continue the
    ///   shutdown operation. When woken up this method should be called again.
    ///
    /// * `Poll::Ready(Err(e))` - indicates a fatal error has happened with shutdown,
    ///   indicating that the shutdown operation did not complete successfully.
    ///   This typically means that the I/O object is no longer usable.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function can return normal I/O errors through `Err`, described
    /// above. Additionally this method may also render the underlying
    /// `Write::write` method no longer usable (e.g. will return errors in the
    /// future). It's recommended that once `shutdown` is called the
    /// `write` method is no longer called.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// This function will panic if not called within the context of a future's
