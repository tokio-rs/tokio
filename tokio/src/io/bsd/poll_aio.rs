/// by the reactor.

/// The wrapped source may be accessed through the `Aio` via the `Deref` and
/// `DerefMut` traits.
///
/// ## Clearing readiness
///
/// If [`Aio::poll_ready`] returns ready, but the consumer determines that the
/// Source is not completely ready and must return to the Pending state,
/// [`Aio::clear_ready`] may be used.  This can be useful with
/// [`lio_listio`], which may generate a kevent when only a portion of the
/// operations have completed.
///
/// ## Platforms
///
/// Only FreeBSD implements POSIX AIO with kqueue notification, so
/// `Aio` is only available for that operating system.
///
/// [`lio_listio`]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lio_listio.html
// Note: Unlike every other kqueue event source, POSIX AIO registers events not
// via kevent(2) but when the aiocb is submitted to the kernel via aio_read,
// aio_write, etc.  It needs the kqueue's file descriptor to do that.  So
// AsyncFd can't be used for POSIX AIO.
//
// Note that Aio doesn't implement Drop.  There's no need.  Unlike other
// kqueue sources, simply dropping the object effectively deregisters it.
