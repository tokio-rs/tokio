    /// `PollEvented` uses [`Registration`] internally to take a type that
    /// implements [`mio::Evented`] as well as [`std::io::Read`] and or
    /// [`std::io::Write`] and associate it with a reactor that will drive it.
    ///
    /// Once the [`mio::Evented`] type is wrapped by `PollEvented`, it can be
    /// used from within the future's execution model. As such, the
    /// `PollEvented` type provides [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`]
    /// implementations using the underlying I/O resource as well as readiness
    /// events provided by the reactor.
    ///
    /// **Note**: While `PollEvented` is `Sync` (if the underlying I/O type is
    /// `Sync`), the caller must ensure that there are at most two tasks that
    /// use a `PollEvented` instance concurrently. One for reading and one for
    /// writing. While violating this requirement is "safe" from a Rust memory
    /// model point of view, it will result in unexpected behavior in the form
    /// of lost notifications and tasks hanging.
    ///
    /// ## Readiness events
    ///
    /// Besides just providing [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`] implementations,
    /// this type also supports access to the underlying readiness event stream.
    /// While similar in function to what [`Registration`] provides, the
    /// semantics are a bit different.
    ///
    /// Two functions are provided to access the readiness events:
    /// [`poll_read_ready`] and [`poll_write_ready`]. These functions return the
    /// current readiness state of the `PollEvented` instance. If
    /// [`poll_read_ready`] indicates read readiness, immediately calling
    /// [`poll_read_ready`] again will also indicate read readiness.
    ///
    /// When the operation is attempted and is unable to succeed due to the I/O
    /// resource not being ready, the caller must call [`clear_read_ready`] or
    /// [`clear_write_ready`]. This clears the readiness state until a new
    /// readiness event is received.
    ///
    /// This allows the caller to implement additional functions. For example,
    /// [`TcpListener`] implements poll_accept by using [`poll_read_ready`] and
    /// [`clear_read_ready`].
    ///
    /// ## Platform-specific events
    ///
    /// `PollEvented` also allows receiving platform-specific `mio::Ready` events.
    /// These events are included as part of the read readiness event stream. The
    /// write readiness event stream is only for `Ready::writable()` events.
