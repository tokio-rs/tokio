//! `UnixStream` split support.
//!
//! A `UnixStream` can be split into a read half and a write half with
//! `UnixStream::split`. The read half implements `AsyncRead` while the write
//! half implements `AsyncWrite`.
//!
//! Compared to the generic split of `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`, this specialized
//! split has no associated overhead and enforces all invariants at the type
//! level.
