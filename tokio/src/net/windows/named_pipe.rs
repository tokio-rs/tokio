/// A [Windows named pipe] server.
///
/// Accepting client connections involves creating a server with
/// [`ServerOptions::create`] and waiting for clients to connect using
/// [`NamedPipeServer::connect`].
///
/// To avoid having clients sporadically fail with
/// [`std::io::ErrorKind::NotFound`] when they connect to a server, we must
/// ensure that at least one server instance is available at all times. This
/// means that the typical listen loop for a server is a bit involved, because
/// we have to ensure that we never drop a server accidentally while a client
/// might connect.
///
/// So a correctly implemented server looks like this:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::io;
/// use tokio::net::windows::named_pipe::ServerOptions;
///
/// const PIPE_NAME: &str = r"\\.\pipe\named-pipe-idiomatic-server";
///
/// # #[tokio::main] async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
/// // The first server needs to be constructed early so that clients can
/// // be correctly connected. Otherwise calling .wait will cause the client to
/// // error.
/// //
/// // Here we also make use of `first_pipe_instance`, which will ensure that
/// // there are no other servers up and running already.
/// let mut server = ServerOptions::new()
///     .first_pipe_instance(true)
///     .create(PIPE_NAME)?;
///
/// // Spawn the server loop.
/// let server = tokio::spawn(async move {
///     loop {
///         // Wait for a client to connect.
///         server.connect().await?;
///         let connected_client = server;
///
///         // Construct the next server to be connected before sending the one
///         // we already have of onto a task. This ensures that the server
///         // isn't closed (after it's done in the task) before a new one is
///         // available. Otherwise the client might error with
///         // `io::ErrorKind::NotFound`.
///         server = ServerOptions::new().create(PIPE_NAME)?;
