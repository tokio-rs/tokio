//! An example how to manually assemble a runtime and run some tasks on it.
//!
//! This is closer to the single-threaded runtime than the default tokio one, as it is simpler to
//! grasp. There are conceptually similar, but the multi-threaded one would be more code. If you
//! just want to *use* a single-threaded runtime, use the one provided by tokio directly
//! (`tokio::runtime::current_thread::Runtime::new()`. This is a demonstration only.
//!
//! Note that the error handling is a bit left out. Also, the `run` could be modified to return the
//! result of the provided future.
