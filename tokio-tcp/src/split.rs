//! `TcpStream` split support.
//!
//! A `TcpStream` can be split into a `TcpStreamReadHalf` and a
//! `TcpStreamWriteHalf` with the `TcpStream::split` method. `TcpStreamReadHalf`
//! implements `AsyncRead` while `TcpStreamWriteHalf` implements `AsyncWrite`.
//! The two halves can be used concurrently, even from multiple tasks.
//!
//! Compared to the generic split of `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`, this specialized
//! split gives read and write halves that are faster and smaller, because they
//! do not use locks. They also provide access to the underlying `TcpStream`
//! after split, implementing `AsRef<TcpStream>`. This allows you to call
//! `TcpStream` methods that takes `&self`, e.g., to get local and peer
//! addresses, to get and set socket options, and to shutdown the sockets.
