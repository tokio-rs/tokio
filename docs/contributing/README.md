# Contributing

This guide will help you get started. **Do not let this guide intimidate you**.
It should be considered a map to help you navigate the process.

## Quick start

If you are unsure where to begin, use the following guides:

- Want to report or triage a bug? Start with [Contributing in Issues](contributing-in-issues.md).
- Looking for something to work on? Filter issues by [`E-help-wanted`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/labels/E-help-wanted).
- Planning to submit a PR? Read [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) for the full workflow and required checks.
- Want to understand what the labels on issues mean? See [Keeping track of issues and PRs](keeping-track-of-issues-and-prs.md).
- Interested in code review? See [Reviewing Pull Requests](reviewing-pull-requests.md).
