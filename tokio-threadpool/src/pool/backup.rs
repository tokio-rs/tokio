/// State associated with a thread in the thread pool.
///
/// The pool manages a number of threads. Some of those threads are considered
/// "primary" threads and process the work queue. When a task being run on a
/// primary thread enters a blocking context, the responsibility of processing
/// the work queue must be handed off to another thread. This is done by first
/// checking for idle threads on the backup stack. If one is found, the worker
/// token (`WorkerId`) is handed off to that running thread. If none are found,
/// a new thread is spawned.
///
/// This state manages the exchange. A thread that is idle, not assigned to a
/// work queue, sits around for a specified amount of time. When the worker
/// token is handed off, it is first stored in `handoff`. The backup thread is
/// then signaled. At this point, the backup thread wakes up from sleep and
/// reads `handoff`. At that point, it has been promoted to a primary thread and
/// will begin processing inbound work on the work queue.
///
/// The name `Backup` isn't really great for what the type does, but I have not
/// come up with a better name... Maybe it should just be named `Thread`.
