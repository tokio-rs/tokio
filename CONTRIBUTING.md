## LTS guarantees

Tokio ≥1.0.0 comes with LTS guarantees:

* A minimum of 5 years of maintenance.
* A minimum of 3 years before a hypothetical 2.0 release.

The goal of these guarantees is to provide stability to the ecosystem.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

* All Tokio ≥1.0.0 releases will support at least a 6-month old Rust
  compiler release.
* The MSRV will only be increased on 1.x releases.

## Versioning Policy

With Tokio ≥1.0.0:

* Patch (1.\_.x) releases _should only_ contain bug fixes or documentation
  changes. Besides this, these releases should not substantially change
  runtime behavior.
* Minor (1.x) releases may contain new functionality, MSRV increases (see
  above), minor dependency updates, deprecations, and larger internal
  implementation changes.

This is as defined by [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).

## Conduct

The Tokio project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc]. This describes
the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors. Instances of violations of the
Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the project team at
[moderation@tokio.rs](mailto:moderation@tokio.rs).
