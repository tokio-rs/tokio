# TSAN suppressions file for Tokio

# TSAN does not understand fences and `Arc::drop` is implemented using a fence.
# This causes many false positives.

race:Weak*drop

# `std` mpsc is not used in any Tokio code base. This race is triggered by some
# rust runtime logic.
race:std*mpsc_queue

# Probably more fences in std.

# The epoch-based GC uses fences.

# Push and steal operations in crossbeam-deque may cause data races, but such
# data races are safe. If a data race happens, the value read by `steal` is
# forgotten and the steal operation is then retried.
race:crossbeam_deque*push
race:crossbeam_deque*steal

# This filters out expected data race in the Treiber stack implementations.
# Treiber stacks are inherently racy. The pop operation will attempt to access
# the "next" pointer on the node it is attempting to pop. However, at this
# point it has not gained ownership of the node and another thread might beat
# it and take ownership of the node first (touching the next pointer). The
# original pop operation will fail due to the ABA guard, but tsan still picks
# up the access on the next pointer.
