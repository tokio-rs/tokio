//! Timer implementation.
//!
//! This module contains the types needed to run a timer.
//!
//! The [`Timer`] type runs the timer logic. It holds all the necessary state
//! to track all associated [`Delay`] instances and delivering notifications
//! once the deadlines are reached.
//!
//! The [`Handle`] type is a reference to a [`Timer`] instance. This type is
//! `Clone`, `Send`, and `Sync`. This type is used to create instances of
//! [`Delay`].
//!
//! The [`Now`] trait describes how to get an [`Instant`] representing the
//! current moment in time. [`SystemNow`] is the default implementation, where
//! [`Now::now`] is implemented by calling [`Instant::now`].
//!
//! [`Timer`] is generic over [`Now`]. This allows the source of time to be
//! customized. This ability is especially useful in tests and any environment
//! where determinism is necessary.
//!
//! Note, when using the Tokio runtime, the [`Timer`] does not need to be manually
//! setup as the runtime comes pre-configured with a [`Timer`] instance.
//!

/// Timer implementation that drives [`Delay`], [`Interval`], and [`Timeout`].
///
/// A `Timer` instance tracks the state necessary for managing time and
/// notifying the [`Delay`] instances once their deadlines are reached.
///
/// It is expected that a single `Timer` instance manages many individual
/// [`Delay`] instances. The `Timer` implementation is thread-safe and, as such,
/// is able to handle callers from across threads.
///
/// Callers do not use `Timer` directly to create [`Delay`] instances.  Instead,
/// [`Handle`][Handle.struct] is used. A handle for the timer instance is obtained by calling
/// [`handle`]. [`Handle`][Handle.struct] is the type that implements `Clone` and is `Send +
/// Sync`.
///
/// After creating the `Timer` instance, the caller must repeatedly call
/// [`turn`]. The timer will perform no work unless [`turn`] is called
/// repeatedly.
///
/// The `Timer` has a resolution of one millisecond. Any unit of time that falls
/// between milliseconds are rounded up to the next millisecond.
///
/// When the `Timer` instance is dropped, any outstanding [`Delay`] instance that
/// has not elapsed will be notified with an error. At this point, calling
/// `poll` on the [`Delay`] instance will result in `Err` being returned.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// `Timer` is based on the [paper by Varghese and Lauck][paper].
///
/// A hashed timing wheel is a vector of slots, where each slot handles a time
/// slice. As time progresses, the timer walks over the slot for the current
/// instant, and processes each entry for that slot. When the timer reaches the
/// end of the wheel, it starts again at the beginning.
///
/// The `Timer` implementation maintains six wheels arranged in a set of levels.
/// As the levels go up, the slots of the associated wheel represent larger
/// intervals of time. At each level, the wheel has 64 slots. Each slot covers a
/// range of time equal to the wheel at the lower level. At level zero, each
/// slot represents one millisecond of time.
///
/// The wheels are:
///
/// * Level 0: 64 x 1 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 1: 64 x 64 millisecond slots.
/// * Level 2: 64 x ~4 second slots.
/// * Level 3: 64 x ~4 minute slots.
/// * Level 4: 64 x ~4 hour slots.
/// * Level 5: 64 x ~12 day slots.
///
/// When the timer processes entries at level zero, it will notify all the
/// [`Delay`] instances as their deadlines have been reached. For all higher
/// levels, all entries will be redistributed across the wheel at the next level
/// down. Eventually, as time progresses, entries will [`Delay`] instances will
/// either be canceled (dropped) or their associated entries will reach level
/// zero and be notified.
