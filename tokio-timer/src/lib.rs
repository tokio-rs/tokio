//! Utilities for tracking time.
//!
//! This crate provides a number of utilities for working with periods of time:
//!
//! * [`Delay`]: A future that completes at a specified instant in time.
//!
//! * [`Interval`] A stream that yields at fixed time intervals.
//!
//! * [`Timeout`]: Wraps a future or stream, setting an upper bound to the
//!   amount of time it is allowed to execute. If the future or stream does not
//!   complete in time, then it is canceled and an error is returned.
//!
//! * [`DelayQueue`]: A queue where items are returned once the requested delay
//!   has expired.
//!
//! These three types are backed by a [`Timer`] instance. In order for
//! [`Delay`], [`Interval`], and [`Timeout`] to function, the associated
//! [`Timer`] instance must be running on some thread.
//!
//! [`Delay`]: struct.Delay.html
//! [`Timeout`]: struct.Timeout.html
//! [`Interval`]: struct.Interval.html
//! [`Timer`]: timer/struct.Timer.html
