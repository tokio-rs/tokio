/// Read bytes asynchronously.
///
/// This trait inherits from `std::io::Read` and indicates that an I/O object is
/// **non-blocking**. All non-blocking I/O objects must return an error when
/// bytes are unavailable instead of blocking the current thread.
///
/// Specifically, this means that the `read` function will return one of the
/// following:
///
/// * `Ok(n)` means that `n` bytes of data was immediately read and placed into
///   the output buffer, where `n` == 0 implies that EOF has been reached.
///
/// * `Err(e) if e.kind() == ErrorKind::WouldBlock` means that no data was read
///   into the buffer provided. The I/O object is not currently readable but may
///   become readable in the future. Most importantly, **the current future's
///   task is scheduled to get unparked when the object is readable**. This
///   means that like `Future::poll` you'll receive a notification when the I/O
///   object is readable again.
///
/// * `Err(e)` for other errors are standard I/O errors coming from the
///   underlying object.
///
/// This trait importantly means that the `read` method only works in the
/// context of a future's task. The object may panic if used outside of a task.

    /// able to read data from the buffer passed as an argument. Because of
