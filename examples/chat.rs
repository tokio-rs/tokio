//! A chat server that broadcasts a message to all connections.
//!
//! This example is explicitly more verbose than it has to be. This is to
//! illustrate more concepts.
//!
//! A chat server for telnet clients. After a telnet client connects, the first
//! line should contain the client's name. After that, all lines sent by a
//! client are broadcasted to all other connected clients.
//!
//! Because the client is telnet, lines are delimited by "\r\n".
//!
//! You can test this out by running:
//!
//!     cargo run --example chat
//!
//! And then in another terminal run:
//!
//!     telnet localhost 6142
//!
//! You can run the `telnet` command in any number of additional windows.
//!
//! You can run the second command in multiple windows and then chat between the
//! two, seeing the messages from the other client as they're received. For all
//! connected clients they'll all join the same room and see everyone else's
//! messages.
