## Examples of how to use Tokio

This directory contains a number of examples showcasing various capabilities of
the `tokio` crate.

All examples can be executed with:

```
cargo run --example $name
```

A good starting point for the examples would be [`hello_world`](hello_world.rs)
and [`echo`](echo.rs). Additionally [the tokio website][tokioweb] contains
additional guides for some of the examples.

For a larger "real world" example, see the [`mini-redis`][redis] repository.

If you've got an example you'd like to see here, please feel free to open an
issue. Otherwise if you've got an example you'd like to add, please feel free
to make a PR!
