//! Hello world server.
//!
//! A simple client that opens a TCP stream, writes "hello world\n", and closes
//! the connection.
//!
//! You can test this out by running:
//!
//!     ncat -l 6142
//!
//! And then in another terminal run:
//!
//!     cargo run --example hello_world

    // sockets in our case) have been dropped.
