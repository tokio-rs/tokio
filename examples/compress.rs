//! An example of offloading work to a thread pool instead of doing work on the
//! main event loop.
//!
//! In this example the server will act as a form of echo server except that
//! it'll echo back gzip-compressed data. Each connected client will have the
//! data written streamed back as the compressed version is available, and all
//! compressing will occur on a thread pool rather than the main event loop.
//!
//! You can preview this example with in one terminal:
//!
//!     cargo run --example compress
//!
//! and in another terminal;
//!
//!     echo test | cargo run --example connect 127.0.0.1:8080 | gunzip
//!
//! The latter command will need to be tweaked for non-unix-like shells, but
//! you can also redirect the stdout of the `connect` program to a file
//! and then decompress that.
