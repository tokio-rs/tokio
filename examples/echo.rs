//! A "hello world" echo server with tokio-core
//!
//! This server will create a TCP listener, accept connections in a loop, and
//! simply write back everything that's read off of each TCP connection. Each
//! TCP connection is processed concurrently with all other TCP connections, and
//! each connection will have its own buffer that it's reading in/out of.
//!
//! To see this server in action, you can run this in one terminal:
//!
//!     cargo run --example echo
//!
//! and in another terminal you can run:
//!
//!     cargo run --example connect 127.0.0.1:8080
//!
//! Each line you type in to the `connect` terminal should be echo'd back to
//! you! If you open up multiple terminals running the `connect` example you
//! should be able to see them all make progress simultaneously.

        // each stream independently, such as pass them as two arguments to the
        // `copy` function.
        //
        // The `copy` function then returns a future, and this future will be

        // some work in the background.
        //
        // This function will transfer ownership of the future (`msg` in this
        // case) to the event loop that `handle` points to. The event loop will
        // then drive the future to completion.
