#![feature(async_await)]

//! Event loop that drives Tokio I/O resources.
//!
//! The reactor is the engine that drives asynchronous I/O resources (like TCP and
//! UDP sockets). It is backed by [`mio`] and acts as a bridge between [`mio`] and
//! [`futures`].
//!
//! The crate provides:
//!
//! * [`Reactor`] is the main type of this crate. It performs the event loop logic.
//!
//! * [`Handle`] provides a reference to a reactor instance.
//!
//! * [`Registration`] and [`PollEvented`] allow third parties to implement I/O
//!   resources that are driven by the reactor.
//!
//! Application authors will not use this crate directly. Instead, they will use the
//! `tokio` crate. Library authors should only depend on `tokio-net` if they
//! are building a custom I/O resource.
//!
//! For more details, see [reactor module] documentation in the Tokio crate.
