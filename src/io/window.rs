/// A owned window around an underlying buffer.

/// Normally slices work great for considering sub-portions of a buffer, but
/// unfortunately a slice is a *borrowed* type in Rust which has an associated
/// lifetime. When working with future and async I/O these lifetimes are not
/// always appropriate, and are sometimes difficult to store in tasks. This
/// type strives to fill this gap by providing an "owned slice" around an
/// underlying buffer of bytes.
///
/// A `Window<T>` wraps an underlying buffer, `T`, and has configurable
/// start/end indexes to alter the behavior of the `AsRef<[u8]>` implementation
/// that this type carries.
///
/// This type can be particularly useful when working with the `write_all`
/// combinator in this crate. Data can be sliced via `Window`, consumed by
/// `write_all`, and then earned back once the write operation finishes through
/// the `into_inner` method on this type.
