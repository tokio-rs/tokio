/// potentially "updating" the underlying task to notify. This is useful in
/// scenarios where a computation completes in another thread and wants to
/// notify the consumer, but the consumer is in the process of being migrated to
/// a new logical task.
///
/// Consumers should call `register` before checking the result of a computation
/// and producers should call `notify` after producing the computation (this
/// differs from the usual `thread::park` pattern). It is also permitted for
/// `notify` to be called **before** `register`. This results in a no-op.
///
/// A single `AtomicTask` may be reused for any number of calls to `register` or
/// `notify`.
///
/// `AtomicTask` does not provide any memory ordering guarantees, as such the
/// user should use caution and use other synchronization primitives to guard
/// the result of the underlying computation.
