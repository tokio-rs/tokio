//! Readiness tracking streams, backing I/O objects.
//!
//! This module contains the core type which is used to back all I/O on object
//! in `tokio-core`. The `PollEvented` type is the implementation detail of
//! all I/O. Each `PollEvented` manages registration with a reactor,
//! acquisition of a token, and tracking of the readiness state on the
//! underlying I/O primitive.

/// A concrete implementation of a stream of readiness notifications for I/O
/// objects that originates from an event loop.
///
/// Created by the `PollEvented::new` method, each `PollEvented` is
/// associated with a specific event loop and source of events that will be
/// registered with an event loop.
///
/// An instance of `PollEvented` is essentially the bridge between the `mio`
/// world and the `tokio-core` world, providing abstractions to receive
/// notifications about changes to an object's `mio::Ready` state.
///
/// Each readiness stream has a number of methods to test whether the underlying
/// object is readable or writable. Once the methods return that an object is
/// readable/writable, then it will continue to do so until the `need_read` or
/// `need_write` methods are called.
///
/// That is, this object is typically wrapped in another form of I/O object.
/// It's the responsibility of the wrapper to inform the readiness stream when a
/// "would block" I/O event is seen. The readiness stream will then take care of
/// any scheduling necessary to get notified when the event is ready again.
///
/// You can find more information about creating a custom I/O object [online].
///
/// [online]: https://tokio.rs/docs/going-deeper-tokio/core-low-level/#custom-io
///
/// ## Readiness to read/write
///
/// A `PollEvented` allows listening and waiting for an arbitrary `mio::Ready`
/// instance, including the platform-specific contents of `mio::Ready`. At most
/// two future tasks, however, can be waiting on a `PollEvented`. The
/// `need_read` and `need_write` methods can block two separate tasks, one on
/// reading and one on writing. Not all I/O events correspond to read/write,
/// however!
///
/// To account for this a `PollEvented` gets a little interesting when working
/// with an arbitrary instance of `mio::Ready` that may not map precisely to
/// "write" and "read" tasks. Currently it is defined that instances of
/// `mio::Ready` that do *not* return true from `is_writable` are all notified
/// through `need_read`, or the read task.
///
/// In other words, `poll_ready` with the `mio::UnixReady::hup` event will block
/// the read task of this `PollEvented` if the `hup` event isn't available.
/// Essentially a good rule of thumb is that if you're using the `poll_ready`
/// method you want to also use `need_read` to signal blocking and you should
/// otherwise probably avoid using two tasks on the same `PollEvented`.
