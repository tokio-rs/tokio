//! Readiness tracking streams, backing I/O objects.
//!
//! This module contains the core type which is used to back all I/O on object
//! in `tokio-core`. The `PollEvented` type is the implementation detail of
//! all I/O. Each `PollEvented` manages registration with a reactor,
//! acquisition of a token, and tracking of the readiness state on the
//! underlying I/O primitive.
