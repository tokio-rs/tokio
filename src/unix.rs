// TODO: Go through the docs, they are a copy-paste from the previous version
/// An implementation of `Stream` for receiving a particular type of signal.
///
/// This structure implements the `Stream` trait and represents notifications
/// of the current process receiving a particular signal. The signal being
/// listened for is passed to `Signal::new`, and the same signal number is then
/// yielded as each element for the stream.
///
/// In general signal handling on Unix is a pretty tricky topic, and this
/// structure is no exception! There are some important limitations to keep in
/// mind when using `Signal` streams:
///
/// * While multiple event loops are supported, the *first* event loop to
///   register a signal handler is required to be active to ensure that signals
///   for other event loops are delivered. In other words, once an event loop
///   registers a signal, it's best to keep it around and running. This is
///   normally just a problem for tests, and the "workaround" is to spawn a
///   thread in the background at the beginning of the test suite which is
///   running an event loop (and listening for a signal).
///
/// * Signals handling in Unix already necessitates coalescing signals
///   together sometimes. This `Signal` stream is also no exception here in
///   that it will also coalesce signals. That is, even if the signal handler
///   for this process runs multiple times, the `Signal` stream may only return
///   one signal notification. Specifically, before `poll` is called, all
///   signal notifications are coalesced into one item returned from `poll`.
///   Once `poll` has been called, however, a further signal is guaranteed to
///   be yielded as an item.
///
/// * Signal handling in general is relatively inefficient. Although some
///   improvements are possible in this crate, it's recommended to not plan on
///   having millions of signal channels open.
///
/// * Currently the "driver task" to process incoming signals never exits.
///
/// If you've got any questions about this feel free to open an issue on the
/// repo, though, as I'd love to chat about this! In other words, I'd love to
/// alleviate some of these limitations if possible!

    /// notifications whenever a signal is received. More documentation can be
    /// found on `Signal` itself, but to reiterate:
    ///
    /// * Signals may be coalesced beyond what the kernel already does.
    /// * While multiple event loops are supported, the first event loop to
    ///   register a signal handler must be active to deliver signal
