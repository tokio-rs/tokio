//! Task execution utilities.
//!
//! In the Tokio execution model, futures are lazy. When a future is created, no
//! work is performed. In order for the work defined by the future to happen,
//! the future must be submitted to an executor. A future that is submitted to
//! an executor is called a "task".
//!
//! The executor is responsible for ensuring that [`Future::poll`] is
//! called whenever the task is [notified]. Notification happens when the
//! internal state of a task transitions from "not ready" to ready. For
//! example, a socket might have received data and a call to `read` will now be
//! able to succeed.
//!
//! The specific strategy used to manage the tasks is left up to the
//! executor. There are two main flavors of executors: single-threaded and
//! multithreaded. This module provides both.
//!
//! * **[`current_thread`]**: A single-threaded executor that support spawning
//! tasks that are not `Send`. It guarantees that tasks will be executed on
//! the same thread from which they are spawned.
//!
//! * **[`thread_pool`]**: A multi-threaded executor that maintains a pool of
//! threads. Tasks are spawned to one of the threads in the pool and executed.
//! The pool employs a [work-stealing] strategy for optimizing how tasks get
//! spread across the available threads.
//!
//! # `Executor` trait.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Executor`] trait (re-exported from
//! [`tokio-executor`]), which describes the API that all executors must
//! implement.
//!
//! A free [`spawn`] function is provided that allows spawning futures onto the
//! default executor (tracked via a thread-local variable) without referencing a
//! handle. It is expected that all executors will set a value for the default
//! executor. This value will often be set to the executor itself, but it is
//! possible that the default executor might be set to a different executor.
//!
//! For example, the [`current_thread`] executor might set the default executor
//! to a thread pool instead of itself, allowing futures to spawn new tasks onto
//! the thread pool when those tasks are `Send`.

pub mod current_thread;

pub mod thread_pool {
    //! Maintains a pool of threads across which the set of spawned tasks are
    //! executed.
    //!
    //! [`ThreadPool`] is an executor that uses a thread pool for executing
    //! tasks concurrently across multiple cores. It uses a thread pool that is
    //! optimized for use cases that involve multiplexing large number of
    //! independent tasks that perform short(ish) amounts of computation and are
    //! mainly waiting on I/O, i.e. the Tokio use case.
    //!
    //! Usually, users of [`ThreadPool`] will not create pool instances.
    //! Instead, they will create a [`Runtime`] instance, which comes with a
    //! pre-configured thread pool.
    //!
    //! At the core, [`ThreadPool`] uses a work-stealing based scheduling
    //! strategy. When spawning a task while *external* to the thread pool
    //! (i.e., from a thread that is not part of the thread pool), the task is
    //! randomly assigned to a worker thread. When spawning a task while
    //! *internal* to the thread pool, the task is assigned to the current
    //! worker.
    //!
    //! Each worker maintains its own queue and first focuses on processing all
    //! tasks in its queue. When the worker's queue is empty, the worker will
    //! attempt to *steal* tasks from other worker queues. This strategy helps
    //! ensure that work is evenly distributed across threads while minimizing
    //! synchronization between worker threads.
    //!
    //! # Usage
    //!
    //! Thread pool instances are created using [`ThreadPool::new`] or
    //! [`Builder::new`]. The first option returns a thread pool with default
    //! configuration values. The second option allows configuring the thread
    //! pool before instantiating it.
    //!
    //! Once an instance is obtained, futures may be spawned onto it using the
    //! [`spawn`] function.
    //!
    //! A handle to the thread pool is obtained using [`ThreadPool::sender`].
    //! This handle is **only** able to spawn futures onto the thread pool. It
    //! is unable to affect the lifecycle of the thread pool in any way. This
    //! handle can be passed into functions or stored in structs as a way to
    //! grant the capability of spawning futures.
    //!
    //! # Examples
    //!
    //! ```rust
    //! # extern crate tokio;
    //! # extern crate futures;
    //! # use tokio::executor::thread_pool::ThreadPool;
    //! use futures::future::{Future, lazy};
    //!
    //! # pub fn main() {
    //! // Create a thread pool with default configuration values
    //! let thread_pool = ThreadPool::new();
    //!
    //! thread_pool.spawn(lazy(|| {
    //!     println!("called from a worker thread");
    //!     Ok(())
    //! }));
    //!
    //! // Gracefully shutdown the threadpool
    //! thread_pool.shutdown().wait().unwrap();
    //! # }
    //! ```
