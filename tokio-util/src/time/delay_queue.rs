/// A queue of delayed elements.
///
/// Once an element is inserted into the `DelayQueue`, it is yielded once the
/// specified deadline has been reached.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Elements are inserted into `DelayQueue` using the [`insert`] or
/// [`insert_at`] methods. A deadline is provided with the item and a [`Key`] is
/// returned. The key is used to remove the entry or to change the deadline at
/// which it should be yielded back.
///
/// Once delays have been configured, the `DelayQueue` is used via its
/// [`Stream`] implementation. [`poll_expired`] is called. If an entry has reached its
/// deadline, it is returned. If not, `Poll::Pending` is returned indicating that the
/// current task will be notified once the deadline has been reached.
///
/// # `Stream` implementation
///
/// Items are retrieved from the queue via [`DelayQueue::poll_expired`]. If no delays have
/// expired, no items are returned. In this case, [`Poll::Pending`] is returned and the
/// current task is registered to be notified once the next item's delay has
/// expired.
///
/// If no items are in the queue, i.e. `is_empty()` returns `true`, then `poll`
/// returns `Poll::Ready(None)`. This indicates that the stream has reached an end.
/// However, if a new item is inserted *after*, `poll` will once again start
/// returning items or `Poll::Pending`.
///
/// Items are returned ordered by their expirations. Items that are configured
/// to expire first will be returned first. There are no ordering guarantees
/// for items configured to expire at the same instant. Also note that delays are
/// rounded to the closest millisecond.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The [`DelayQueue`] is backed by a separate instance of a timer wheel similar to that used internally
/// by Tokio's standalone timer utilities such as [`sleep`]. Because of this, it offers the same
/// performance and scalability benefits.
///
/// State associated with each entry is stored in a [`slab`]. This amortizes the cost of allocation,
/// and allows reuse of the memory allocated for expired entries.
///
/// Capacity can be checked using [`capacity`] and allocated preemptively by using
/// the [`reserve`] method.
///
/// # Cancellation safety
///
/// [`DelayQueue`]'s implementation of [`StreamExt::next`] is cancellation safe.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Using [`DelayQueue`] to manage cache entries.
