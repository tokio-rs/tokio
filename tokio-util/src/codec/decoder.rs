/// Decoding of frames via buffers.
///
/// This trait is used when constructing an instance of `Framed` or
/// `FramedRead`. An implementation of `Decoder` takes a byte stream that has
/// already been buffered in `src` and decodes the data into a stream of
/// `Self::Item` frames.
///
/// Implementations are able to track state on `self`, which enables
/// implementing stateful streaming parsers. In many cases, though, this type
/// will simply be a unit struct (e.g. `struct HttpDecoder`).
pub trait Decoder {
    /// The type of decoded frames.
    type Item;

    /// The type of unrecoverable frame decoding errors.
    ///
    /// If an individual message is ill-formed but can be ignored without
    /// interfering with the processing of future messages, it may be more
    /// useful to report the failure as an `Item`.
    ///
    /// `From<io::Error>` is required in the interest of making `Error` suitable
    /// for returning directly from a `FramedRead`, and to enable the default
    /// implementation of `decode_eof` to yield an `io::Error` when the decoder
    /// fails to consume all available data.
    ///
    /// Note that implementors of this trait can simply indicate `type Error =
    /// io::Error` to use I/O errors as this type.
    type Error: From<io::Error>;

    /// Attempts to decode a frame from the provided buffer of bytes.
    ///
    /// This method is called by `FramedRead` whenever bytes are ready to be
    /// parsed.  The provided buffer of bytes is what's been read so far, and
    /// this instance of `Decode` can determine whether an entire frame is in
    /// the buffer and is ready to be returned.
    ///
    /// If an entire frame is available, then this instance will remove those
    /// bytes from the buffer provided and return them as a decoded
    /// frame. Note that removing bytes from the provided buffer doesn't always
    /// necessarily copy the bytes, so this should be an efficient operation in
    /// most circumstances.
    ///
    /// If the bytes look valid, but a frame isn't fully available yet, then
    /// `Ok(None)` is returned. This indicates to the `Framed` instance that
    /// it needs to read some more bytes before calling this method again.
    ///
    /// Note that the bytes provided may be empty. If a previous call to
    /// `decode` consumed all the bytes in the buffer then `decode` will be
    /// called again until it returns `Ok(None)`, indicating that more bytes need to
    /// be read.
    ///
    /// Finally, if the bytes in the buffer are malformed then an error is
    /// returned indicating why. This informs `Framed` that the stream is now
    /// corrupt and should be terminated.
    ///
    /// # Buffer management
    ///
    /// Before returning from the function, implementations should ensure that
    /// the buffer has appropriate capacity in anticipation of future calls to
    /// `decode`. Failing to do so leads to inefficiency.
    ///
    /// For example, if frames have a fixed length, or if the length of the
    /// current frame is known from a header, a possible buffer management
