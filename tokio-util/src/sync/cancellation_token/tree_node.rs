//! This mod provides the logic for the inner tree structure of the `CancellationToken`.
//!
//! `CancellationTokens` are only light handles with references to [`TreeNode`].
//! All the logic is actually implemented in the [`TreeNode`].
//!
//! A [`TreeNode`] is part of the cancellation tree and may have one parent and an arbitrary number of
//! children.
//!
//! A [`TreeNode`] can receive the request to perform a cancellation through a `CancellationToken`.
//! This cancellation request will cancel the node and all of its descendants.
//!
//! As soon as a node cannot get cancelled any more (because it was already cancelled or it has no
//! more `CancellationTokens` pointing to it any more), it gets removed from the tree, to keep the
//! tree as small as possible.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! Those invariants shall be true at any time.
//!
//! 1. A node that has no parents and no handles can no longer be cancelled.
//!     This is important during both cancellation and refcounting.
//!
//! 2. If node B *is* or *was* a child of node A, then node B was created *after* node A.
//!     This is important for deadlock safety, as it is used for lock order.
//!     Node B can only become the child of node A in two ways:
//!         - being created with `child_node()`, in which case it is trivially true that
//!           node A already existed when node B was created
//!         - being moved A->C->B to A->B because node C was removed in `decrease_handle_refcount()`
//!           or `cancel()`. In this case the invariant still holds, as B was younger than C, and C
//!           was younger than A, therefore B is also younger than A.
//!
//! 3. If two nodes are both unlocked and node A is the parent of node B, then node B is a child of
//!    node A. It is important to always restore that invariant before dropping the lock of a node.
//!
//! # Deadlock safety
//!
//! We always lock in the order of creation time. We can prove this through invariant #2.
//! Specifically, through invariant #2, we know that we always have to lock a parent
//! before its child.
//!
