/// A collection of tasks spawned on a Tokio runtime, associated with hash map

///
/// This type is very similar to the [`JoinSet`] type in `tokio::task`, with the
/// addition of a  set of keys associated with each task. These keys allow
/// [cancelling a task][abort] or [multiple tasks][abort_matching] in the
/// `JoinMap` based on   their keys, or [test whether a task corresponding to a
/// given key exists][contains] in the `JoinMap`.
///
/// In addition, when tasks in the `JoinMap` complete, they will return the
/// associated key along with the value returned by the task, if any.
///
/// A `JoinMap` can be used to await the completion of some or all of the tasks
/// in the map. The map is not ordered, and the tasks will be returned in the
/// order they complete.
///
/// All of the tasks must have the same return type `V`.
///
/// When the `JoinMap` is dropped, all tasks in the `JoinMap` are immediately aborted.
///

///

///
/// ```
/// use tokio_util::task::JoinMap;
///
/// # #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]

///     map.spawn(i, async move { /* ... */ });

///
/// let mut seen = [false; 10];
///
/// // When a task completes, `join_next` returns the task's key along
/// // with its output.
/// while let Some((key, res)) = map.join_next().await {
