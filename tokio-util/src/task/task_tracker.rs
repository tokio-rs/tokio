/// A task tracker used for waiting until tasks exit.
///
/// This is usually used together with [`CancellationToken`] to implement [graceful shutdown]. The
/// `CancellationToken` is used to signal to tasks that they should shut down, and the
/// `TaskTracker` is used to wait for them to finish shutting down.
///
/// The `TaskTracker` will also keep track of a `closed` boolean. This is used to handle the case
/// where the `TaskTracker` is empty, but we don't want to shut down yet. This means that the
/// [`wait`] method will wait until *both* of the following happen at the same time:
///
///  * The `TaskTracker` must be closed using the [`close`] method.
///  * The `TaskTracker` must be empty, that is, all tasks that it is tracking must have exited.
///
/// When a call to [`wait`] returns, it is guaranteed that all tracked tasks have exited and that
/// the destructor of the future has finished running. However, there might be a short amount of
/// time where [`JoinHandle::is_finished`] returns false.
///
/// # Comparison to `JoinSet`
///
/// The main Tokio crate has a similar collection known as [`JoinSet`]. The `JoinSet` type has a
/// lot more features than `TaskTracker`, so `TaskTracker` should only be used when one of its
/// unique features is required:
///
///  1. When tasks exit, a `TaskTracker` will allow the task to immediately free its memory.
///  2. By not closing the `TaskTracker`, [`wait`] will be prevented from from returning even if
///     the `TaskTracker` is empty.
///  3. A `TaskTracker` does not require mutable access to insert tasks.
///  4. A `TaskTracker` can be cloned to share it with many tasks.
///
/// The first point is the most important one. A [`JoinSet`] keeps track of the return value of
/// every inserted task. This means that if the caller keeps inserting tasks and never calls
/// [`join_next`], then their return values will keep building up and consuming memory, _even if_
/// most of the tasks have already exited. This can cause the process to run out of memory. With a
/// `TaskTracker`, this does not happen. Once tasks exit, they are immediately removed from the
/// `TaskTracker`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// For more examples, please see the topic page on [graceful shutdown].
///
/// ## Spawn tasks and wait for them to exit
///
/// This is a simple example. For this case, [`JoinSet`] should probably be used instead.
///
/// ```
/// use tokio_util::task::TaskTracker;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let tracker = TaskTracker::new();
///
///     for i in 0..10 {
///         tracker.spawn(async move {
///             println!("Task {} is running!", i);
///         });
///     }
///     // Once we spawned everything, we close the tracker.
///     tracker.close();
///
///     // Wait for everything to finish.
///     tracker.wait().await;
///
///     println!("This is printed after all of the tasks.");
/// }
