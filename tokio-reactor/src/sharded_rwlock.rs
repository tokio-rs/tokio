/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any point in time. The
/// write portion of this lock typically allows modification of the underlying data (exclusive
/// access) and the read portion of this lock typically allows for read-only access (shared
/// access).
///
/// This reader-writer lock differs from typical implementations in that it internally creates a
/// list of reader-writer locks called 'shards'. Shards are aligned and padded to the cache line
/// size.
///
/// Read operations lock only one shard specific to the current thread, while write operations lock
/// every shard in succession. This strategy makes concurrent read operations faster due to less
/// contention, but write operations are slower due to increased amount of locking.
