# tokio-reactor

Event loop that drives Tokio I/O resources.

[Documentation](https://tokio-rs.github.io/tokio/tokio_reactor/)

## Overview

The reactor is the engine that drives asynchronous I/O resources (like TCP and
UDP sockets). It is backed by [`mio`] and acts as a bridge between [`mio`] and
[`futures`].

The crate provides:

* [`Reactor`] is the main type of this crate. It performs the event loop logic.

* [`Handle`] provides a reference to a reactor instance.

* [`Registration`] and [`PollEvented`] allow third parties to implement I/O
  resources that are driven by the reactor.

Application authors will not use this crate directly. Instead, they will use the
[`tokio`] crate. Library authors should only depend on `tokio-reactor` if they
are building a custom I/O resource.
