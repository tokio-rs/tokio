/// Represents a stream which receives "ctrl-c" notifications sent to the process.

/// In general signals are handled very differently across Unix and Windows, but
/// this is somewhat cross platform in terms of how it can be handled. A ctrl-c
/// event to a console process can be represented as a stream for both Windows
/// and Unix.
///
/// Note that there are a number of caveats listening for signals, and you may
/// wish to read up on the documentation in the `unix` or `windows` module to
/// take a peek.
///
/// Notably, a notification to this process notifies *all* streams listening to
/// this event. Moreover, the notifications **are coalesced** if they aren't processed
/// quickly enough. This means that if two notifications are received back-to-back,
/// then the stream may only receive one item about the two notifications.
