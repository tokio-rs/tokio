/// An implementation of `Stream` for receiving a particular type of signal.
///
/// This structure implements the `Stream` trait and represents notifications
/// of the current process receiving a particular signal. The signal being
/// listened for is passed to `Signal::new`, and the same signal number is then
/// yielded as each element for the stream.
///
/// In general signal handling on Unix is a pretty tricky topic, and this
/// structure is no exception! There are some important limitations to keep in
/// mind when using `Signal` streams:
///
/// * Signals handling in Unix already necessitates coalescing signals
///   together sometimes. This `Signal` stream is also no exception here in
///   that it will also coalesce signals. That is, even if the signal handler
///   for this process runs multiple times, the `Signal` stream may only return
///   one signal notification. Specifically, before `poll` is called, all
///   signal notifications are coalesced into one item returned from `poll`.
///   Once `poll` has been called, however, a further signal is guaranteed to
///   be yielded as an item.
///
///   Put another way, any element pulled off the returned stream corresponds to
///   *at least one* signal, but possibly more.
///
/// * Signal handling in general is relatively inefficient. Although some
///   improvements are possible in this crate, it's recommended to not plan on
///   having millions of signal channels open.
///
/// * Currently the "driver task" to process incoming signals never exits. This
///   driver task runs in the background of the event loop provided, and
///   in general you shouldn't need to worry about it.
///
/// If you've got any questions about this feel free to open an issue on the
/// repo, though, as I'd love to chat about this! In other words, I'd love to
/// alleviate some of these limitations if possible!
