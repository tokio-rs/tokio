//! Asynchronous signal handling for Tokio
//!
//! This crate implements asynchronous signal handling for Tokio, an
//! asynchronous I/O framework in Rust. The primary type exported from this
//! crate, `unix::Signal`, allows listening for arbitrary signals on Unix
//! platforms, receiving them in an asynchronous fashion.
//!
//! Note that signal handling is in general a very tricky topic and should be
//! used with great care. This crate attempts to implement 'best practice' for
//! signal handling, but it should be evaluated for your own applications' needs
//! to see if it's suitable.
//!
//! The are some fundamental limitations of this crate documented on the
//! `Signal` structure as well.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Print out all ctrl-C notifications received
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! extern crate futures;
//! extern crate tokio;
//! extern crate tokio_signal;
//!
//! use futures::{Future, Stream};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create an infinite stream of "Ctrl+C" notifications. Each item received
//!     // on this stream may represent multiple ctrl-c signals.
//!     let ctrl_c = tokio_signal::ctrl_c().flatten_stream();
//!
//!     // Process each ctrl-c as it comes in
//!     let prog = ctrl_c.for_each(|()| {
//!         println!("ctrl-c received!");
//!         Ok(())
//!     });
//!
//!     tokio::runtime::current_thread::block_on_all(prog).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Wait for SIGHUP on Unix
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # extern crate tokio;
//! # extern crate tokio_signal;
//! # #[cfg(unix)]
//! # mod foo {
//! #
//! extern crate futures;
//! extern crate tokio;
//! extern crate tokio_signal;
//!
//! use futures::{Future, Stream};
//! use tokio_signal::unix::{Signal, SIGHUP};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Like the previous example, this is an infinite stream of signals
//!     // being received, and signals may be coalesced while pending.
//!     let stream = Signal::new(SIGHUP).flatten_stream();
//!
//!     // Convert out stream into a future and block the program
//!     tokio::runtime::current_thread::block_on_all(stream.into_future()).ok().unwrap();
//! }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
