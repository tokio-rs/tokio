//! An asynchronous `Mutex`-like type.
//!
//! This module provides [`Lock`], a type that acts similarly to an asynchronous `Mutex`, with one
//! major difference: the [`LockGuard`] returned by `poll_lock` is not tied to the lifetime of the
//! `Mutex`. This enables you to acquire a lock, and then pass that guard into a future, and then
//! release it at some later point in time.
//!
//! This allows you to do something along the lines of:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # #[macro_use]
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # extern crate tokio;
//! # use futures::{future, Poll, Async, Future, Stream};
//! use tokio::sync::lock::{Lock, LockGuard};
//! struct MyType<S> {
//!     lock: Lock<S>,
//! }
//!
//! impl<S> Future for MyType<S>
//!   where S: Stream<Item = u32> + Send + 'static
//! {
//!     type Item = ();
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error> {
//!         match self.lock.poll_lock() {
//!             Async::Ready(mut guard) => {
//!                 tokio::spawn(future::poll_fn(move || {
//!                     let item = try_ready!(guard.poll().map_err(|_| ()));
//!                     println!("item = {:?}", item);
//!                     Ok(().into())
//!                 }));
//!                 Ok(().into())
//!             },
//!             Async::NotReady => Ok(Async::NotReady)
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
