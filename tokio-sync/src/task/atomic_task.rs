/// A synchronization primitive for task notification.
///
/// `AtomicTask` will coordinate concurrent notifications with the consumer
/// potentially "updating" the underlying task to notify. This is useful in
/// scenarios where a computation completes in another thread and wants to
/// notify the consumer, but the consumer is in the process of being migrated to
/// a new logical task.
///
/// Consumers should call `register` before checking the result of a computation
/// and producers should call `notify` after producing the computation (this
/// differs from the usual `thread::park` pattern). It is also permitted for
/// `notify` to be called **before** `register`. This results in a no-op.
///
/// A single `AtomicTask` may be reused for any number of calls to `register` or
/// `notify`.
///
/// `AtomicTask` does not provide any memory ordering guarantees, as such the
/// user should use caution and use other synchronization primitives to guard
/// the result of the underlying computation.

}

// `AtomicTask` is a multi-consumer, single-producer transfer cell. The cell
// stores a `Task` value produced by calls to `register` and many threads can
// race to take the task (to notify it) by calling `notify.
//
// If a new `Task` instance is produced by calling `register` before an existing
// one is consumed, then the existing one is overwritten.
//
// While `AtomicTask` is single-producer, the implementation ensures memory
// safety. In the event of concurrent calls to `register`, there will be a
// single winner whose task will get stored in the cell. The losers will not
// have their tasks notified. As such, callers should ensure to add
// synchronization to calls to `register`.
//
// The implementation uses a single `AtomicUsize` value to coordinate access to
// the `Task` cell. There are two bits that are operated on independently. These
// are represented by `REGISTERING` and `NOTIFYING`.
//
// The `REGISTERING` bit is set when a producer enters the critical section. The
// `NOTIFYING` bit is set when a consumer enters the critical section. Neither
// bit being set is represented by `WAITING`.
//
// A thread obtains an exclusive lock on the task cell by transitioning the
// state from `WAITING` to `REGISTERING` or `NOTIFYING`, depending on the
// operation the thread wishes to perform. When this transition is made, it is
// guaranteed that no other thread will access the task cell.
//
// # Registering
//
// On a call to `register`, an attempt to transition the state from WAITING to
// REGISTERING is made. On success, the caller obtains a lock on the task cell.
//
// If the lock is obtained, then the thread sets the task cell to the task
// provided as an argument. Then it attempts to transition the state back from
// `REGISTERING` -> `WAITING`.
//
// If this transition is successful, then the registering process is complete
// and the next call to `notify` will observe the task.
//
// If the transition fails, then there was a concurrent call to `notify` that
// was unable to access the task cell (due to the registering thread holding the
// lock). To handle this, the registering thread removes the task it just set
// from the cell and calls `notify` on it. This call to notify represents the
// attempt to notify by the other thread (that set the `NOTIFYING` bit). The
// state is then transitioned from `REGISTERING | NOTIFYING` back to `WAITING`.
// This transition must succeed because, at this point, the state cannot be
// transitioned by another thread.
//
// # Notifying
//
// On a call to `notify`, an attempt to transition the state from `WAITING` to
// `NOTIFYING` is made. On success, the caller obtains a lock on the task cell.
//
// If the lock is obtained, then the thread takes ownership of the current value
// in teh task cell, and calls `notify` on it. The state is then transitioned
// back to `WAITING`. This transition must succeed as, at this point, the state
// cannot be transitioned by another thread.
//
// If the thread is unable to obtain the lock, the `NOTIFYING` bit is still.
// This is because it has either been set by the current thread but the previous
// value included the `REGISTERING` bit **or** a concurrent thread is in the
// `NOTIFYING` critical section. Either way, no action must be taken.
//
// If the current thread is the only concurrent call to `notify` and another
// thread is in the `register` critical section, when the other thread **exits**
// the `register` critical section, it will observe the `NOTIFYING` bit and
// handle the notify itself.
//
// If another thread is in the `notify` critical section, then it will handle
// notifying the task.
//
// # A potential race (is safely handled).
//
// Imagine the following situation:
//
// * Thread A obtains the `notify` lock and notifies a task.
//
// * Before thread A releases the `notify` lock, the notified task is scheduled.
//
// * Thread B attempts to notify the task. In theory this should result in the
//   task being notified, but it cannot because thread A still holds the notify
//   lock.
//
// This case is handled by requiring users of `AtomicTask` to call `register`
// **before** attempting to observe the application state change that resulted
// in the task being notified. The notifiers also change the application state
// before calling notify.
//
// Because of this, the task will do one of two things.
//
// 1) Observe the application state change that Thread B is notifying on. In
//    this case, it is OK for Thread B's notification to be lost.
//
// 2) Call register before attempting to observe the application state. Since
//    Thread A still holds the `notify` lock, the call to `register` will result
//    in the task notifying itself and get scheduled again.
