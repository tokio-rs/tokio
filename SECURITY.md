## Report a security issue

The Tokio project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [security@tokio.rs](mailto:security@tokio.rs).

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via [Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories).

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. The Tokio team announces security issues via [project Github Release notes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/releases) and the [RustSec advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) (i.e. `cargo-audit`).
