//! Spans represent periods of time in the execution of a program.
//!
//! # Entering a Span
//!
//! A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it begins executing,
//! and _exit_ the span when it switches to another context. Spans may be
//! entered through the [`enter`](`Span::enter`) method, which enters the target span,
//! performs a given function (either a closure or a function pointer), exits
//! the span, and then returns the result.
//!
//! Calling `enter` on a span handle enters the span that handle corresponds to,
//! if the span exists:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! let my_var: u64 = 5;
//! let mut my_span = span!("my_span", my_var = &my_var);
//!
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//! });
//!
//! // Perform some work outside of the context of `my_span`...
//!
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // Perform some more work in the context of `my_span`.
//! });
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # The Span Lifecycle
//!
//! Execution may enter and exit a span multiple times before that
//! span is _closed_. Consider, for example, a future which has an associated
//! span and enters that span every time it is polled:
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # use futures::{Future, Poll, Async};
//! struct MyFuture {
//!    // data
//!    span: tokio_trace::Span,
//! }
//!
//! impl Future for MyFuture {
//!     type Item = ();
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error> {
//!         self.span.enter(|| {
//!             // Do actual future work
//! # Ok(Async::Ready(()))
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If this future was spawned on an executor, it might yield one or more times
//! before `poll` returns `Ok(Async::Ready)`. If the future were to yield, then
//! the executor would move on to poll the next future, which may _also_ enter
//! an associated span or series of spans. Therefore, it is valid for a span to
//! be entered repeatedly before it completes. Only the time when that span or
//! one of its children was the current span is considered to be time spent in
//! that span. A span which is not executing and has not yet been closed is said
//! to be _idle_.
//!
//! Because spans may be entered and exited multiple times before they close,
//! [`Subscriber`]s have separate trait methods which are called to notify them
//! of span exits and when span handles are dropped. When execution exits a
//! span, [`exit`](::Subscriber::exit) will always be called with that span's ID
//! to notify the subscriber that the span has been exited. When span handles
//! are dropped, the [`drop_span`](::Subscriber::drop_span) method is called
//! with that span's ID. The subscriber may use this to determine whether or not
//! the span will be entered again.
//!
//! If there is only a single handle with the capacity to exit a span, dropping
//! that handle "close" the span, since the capacity to enter it no longer
//! exists. For example:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! {
//!     span!("my_span").enter(|| {
//!         // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//!     }); // --> Subscriber::exit(my_span)
//!
//!     // The handle to `my_span` only lives inside of this block; when it is
//!     // dropped, the subscriber will be informed that `my_span` has closed.
//!
//! } // --> Subscriber::close(my_span)
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! A span may be explicitly closed by dropping a handle to it, if it is the only
//! handle to that span.
//! time it is exited. For example:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! use tokio_trace::Span;
//!
//! let my_span = span!("my_span");
//! // Drop the handle to the span.
//! drop(my_span); // --> Subscriber::drop_span(my_span)
//! # }
//! ```
//! However, if multiple handles exist, the span can still be re-entered even if
//! one or more is dropped. For determining when _all_ handles to a span have
//! been dropped, `Subscriber`s have a [`clone_span`](::Subscriber::clone_span)
//! method, which is called every time a span handle is cloned. Combined with
//! `drop_span`, this may be used to track the number of handles to a given span
//! — if `drop_span` has been called one more time than the number of calls to
//! `clone_span` for a given ID, then no more handles to the span with that ID
//! exist. The subscriber may then treat it as closed.
//!
//! # Accessing a Span's Attributes
//!
//! The [`Attributes`] type represents a *non-entering* reference to a `Span`'s data
//! — a set of key-value pairs (known as _fields_), a creation timestamp,
//! a reference to the span's parent in the trace tree, and metadata describing
//! the source code location where the span was created. This data is provided
//! to the [`Subscriber`] when the span is created; it may then choose to cache
//! the data for future use, record it in some manner, or discard it completely.
//!
//! [`Subscriber`]: ::Subscriber
