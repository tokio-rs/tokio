/// `Event`s represent single points in time where something occurred during the
/// execution of a program.
///
/// An `Event` can be compared to a log record in unstructured logging, but with
/// two key differences:
/// - `Event`s exist _within the context of a [span]_. Unlike log lines, they
///   may be located within the trace tree, allowing visibility into the
///   _temporal_ context in which the event occurred, as well as the source
///   code location.
/// - Like spans, `Event`s have structured key-value data known as _[fields]_,
///   which may include textual message. In general, a majority of the data
///   associated with an event should be in the event's fields rather than in
///   the textual message, as the fields are more structed.
